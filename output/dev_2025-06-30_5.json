In short: Apple product launch generates much hype. Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose. The more things change, the more they remain the same. However, it is not, for once, a device that is catching all the attention — it is a “design language”.\n\n## UX is now the core differentiator of the Apple brand\n\nSo, Liquid Gas…er..

I’d like to thank my mother and father, my teachers, my wife and my agent, Siri, who always believed in me…\n\nBy placing smooth user journeys across its platforms at the heart of the brand, Apple has made explicit that user experience is the main differentiator from its competition. It kinda felt super trite to type that out. An exercise in the obvious.\n\nA ruthlessly minimalistic form of Glassmorphism goes from trend to a core pillar of design.

Despite the advancements in technology, the same old organisational problems persist. That’s what I want to discuss — and it begins with a message I received one evening.\n\nIt’s late, and my phone pings. A former work colleague has sent me a message asking for my thoughts on a _LinkedIn_ post. It’s a snapshot of a growing tension I’ve seen play out across the design industry again and again.\n\nA snapshot of the growing tension in the design industry.

Meanwhile, recruitment specialist _Tom Scott_ highlights some symptoms: flatter design teams and a deeper focus on craft.\n\nWe see tools, teams, and technologies evolve constantly.

FAANGs are responsible for a lot of design innovation.\n\nHowever, centering the design discourse around how big tech designs warps the perception of young designers of how design should be done.\n\nBeing a solo designer is more common than you think\n===================================================\n\nIn the US [99.9% of all businesses are small businesses](https://www.clearlypayments.com/blog/the-number-of-businesses-in-the-usa-and-statistics-for-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=99.9%25%20(31.7%20million)%20of%20all%20businesses%20are%20small%20businesses). It’s common for B2B startups to [hire a designer among their first 3 hires](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/hiring-your-early-team-b2b) and, for some, it’s the [19th or 20th hire](https://uxdesign.cc/213c307e78ec809fa529ceb0e4550cc5?pvs=25).\n\nThis means that the majority of (tech) companies in the US —and probably in the world— operate with just one designer. Yet when I speak with young designers, all they want to talk about is big tech design.\n\nI’ve been a founding and solo designer 3x in my career and I love the role. So I want to do my part in helping solo designers share the spotlight and hopefully inspire more folks to take on the challenge.\n\nSolo designer or founding designer?\n===================================\n\nNot all solo designers are founding designers and not all founding designers are part of the founding team. Founding designer is an unofficial title some startups give to their first design hire.\n\nHowever, the designers I’ve spoken to prefer the title _solo designer_ so, for simplicity sake, that’s what I often use.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s talk about the job.\n\nThe most exciting role of your career\n=====================================\n\nBeing a solo designer is an opportunity to do unique work and shape the design direction of a company. You get to develop a wide range of skills and, if you’re lucky, you’ll build a team to expand on your foundations.\n\nHowever, if you don’t have a lot of experience, or you prefer structured environments, being a solo designer will not be for you.\n\nDifferences with big tech\n=========================\n\n**Designers at big techs work on problems that someone else scoped out**. Solo designers at startups have a lot more ownership over identifying and scoping problems worth solving.\n\n**They spend a large chunk of their day aligning stakeholders**. If you ask anyone working at a large organization what they spend most of their time on, you’ll get the same answer: “meetings”.\n\nMeetings can be important work, and they can be interesting, but it’s not what many designers would call fun.\n\nFrom the book “Sprint” by Jake Knapp and John Zeratski.\n\n**Big orgs tend to pay much better than startups.** As a solo designers, a lot of your compensation will come in the form of _equity —_ you get to own a piece of the business_—_ and sure, until the startup hits product-market fit, equity is the equivalent of monopoly money. If that happens, oh boy you’ll have a big pay day.\n\n**You also get paid in reputation.** It’s hard to put a price on the prestige of working in big tech. Your parents sleep better a night if you work at a company that “exists”. You tell people where you work and they go “oooh, nice”. But if your startup makes it, you’ll become the coveted “[zero-to-one designer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomscottt_most-in-demand-roles-were-working-on-activity-7204752119885676547-S6Va?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAASzl4UBP_TJGJE1CD5xQypUzdKfLxx2My0)\n” that recruiters drool over and that can open many doors of its own.\n\nSolo designer isn’t for the faint-hearted\n=========================================\n\nAs a solo designer you often have to navigate challenges of influence, bandwidth, and scope of responsibility. All without having other design colleagues to bounce off ideas and getting support.\n\nYou are the director and the intern. You’ll spend Mondays working on high-level strategic research and Tuesdays creating social media assets. You’ll have to do a lot of stuff most designers look down upon, like making your boss’s pitch deck “pop”.\n\nThe responsibilities that would otherwise be split among multiple designers with varying levels of experience, are now all yours. You have a lot of leverage, but it can be hard to cope, especially if you’re early in your career.\n\nIt shouldn’t be your first gig\n==============================\n\nAs if building a design practice from scratch wasn’t hard enough, doing it without a frame of reference is a recipe for insanity.\n\nAs a solo designer, you don’t have a lot of time to research and figure out how to do things. You’ll do much better if you’ve worked at other companies and you have an idea of where you want to take things.\n\nHowever, if you’re a speed-learning machine, it can be extremely satisfying to be able to read a book on a specific topic and applying what you learn the next day.\n\nBe a pragmatic generalist\n=========================\n\nThis is the ultimate individual contributor (IC) role and you’ll thrive if you are a generalist who can see the big picture.\n\nFor example, building a comprehensive design system should be quite far down your list of priorities. There are tons of free [frameworks](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [templates](https://www.framer.com/marketplace/templates/), that it’d be foolish to burn your scarce time building and maintaining a custom library of styles and components.\n\nWith free resources like Tailwind, it’s hard to justify spending days creating custom color scales from scratch.\n\nInstead, you can focus on creating systems for iterating fast and [hitting product-market fit as quickly as possible](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-velocity-baafdc17aae3).\n\nIf your startup succeeds, and you get to build a team, you’ll have plenty of time to worry about building a great system.\n\nSolo doesn’t have to mean alone\n===============================\n\nAs a solo designer, you shouldn’t think of yourself as a lone wolf. Instead, you should double-down on cross-disciplinary collaboration.\n\nIn the lack of dedicated teams for research and product management you are responsible for weaving the connective tissue between customers and stakeholders.\n\nMeet people, ask for advice, learn from others.\n\nWhy would you want to be a solo designer?\n=========================================\n\nIf you’ve read this far, you now realize choosing between big tech and solo designer at a startup is not that straightforward. Here’s a quick summary to help you make up your mind.\n\nBeing a solo designer means:\n\n*   Taking responsibility for the design practice of the company. Branding, visual language, research methods, and building design maturity.\n*   Getting to decide on the design strategy of the startup. What are your market’s unmet needs and how your startup will tackle them.\n*   The ultimate IC role. You get to experiment with tools and methods to figure out what works best for your startup.\n*   Financial and reputational equity. You have skin in the game, not only financially, but also on the attribution of success or failure.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nBeing a solo designer is not for everybody. But it’s an opportunity for you to do unique work. It allows you to develop a wide range of skills and influence the design direction of your company.\n\nIt is especially interesting for mid-to-senior designers who want to work on many different product challenges, and who already have a sense of what good design practices look like.\n\nSure, it doesn’t have the sex appeal of working at a big company, but I’d argue it can be a lot more",

      "content": "# The broken rhetoric of AI\n\n_A detox guide for designers navigating today’s AI discourse_\n\n![Mike Schindler](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*Oo3S32Y2BwsUKXKOLqucYA@2x.jpeg)\n\n[Mike Schindler](https://medium.com/@mschindler?source=post_page---byline--f3a24165899d---------------------------------------)\n\n9 min read\n\n·\n\n4 days ago\n\nAI-generated image by Mike Schindler\n\nWe really have some shitty ways of talking about AI.\n\nWe’re about a year into the Great AI Divide, or whatever our history-keeping algorithms decide to call this moment, and even the most literate among us can’t help falling into the same old rhetorical pitfalls — ones that seem to alienate more people than they invite into the conversation.\n\nWe’re losing ourselves to our worst instincts. Not because we’re doomed, but because we’re treating this moment like a game of hot takes and hustle. But right now is actually a rare and real opportunity for a smarter, more generous conversation — one that helps our design community navigate uncertainty with clarity, creativity, and a sense of shared agency.\n\nInstead, we’ve turned the discourse into a pissing contest.\n\nWho can get the most engagement?\n\nWho can rattle the most nerves?\n\nWho can [split the room](https://www.jackboxgames.com/games/split-the-room) and put the most distance between the supposedly old “archaic” ways and the newer, more exciting, vibey ones?\n\nIn this process we never think to ask if abdicating our creative judgment almost completely to the Large Language Model gods is a good idea. It’s like we’re a tribe of primitive Luddites offering up our drudgery in return for a magical oracle that only rewards the loudest acolytes.\n\nWe’re playing into our performative identities because we’re afraid of being left out in the cold.\n\nMeanwhile, we’re forgetting the most important thing:\n\n**There _are_ healthier ways to talk about all this.**\n\nNot to conjure a rose-colored world from the early 2000’s, but it was almost the exact same landscape of uncertainty, excitement, and novelty way back then. But somehow our approach and our sense of community was totally different.\n\nMaybe Limp Bizkit deserves more credit… hmm… (remembers the backwards red hat)… nah.\n\nBut I do remember because I was there. A lot of us were. And the evidence of the discourse taking a dangerous corner today is all around us.\n\n**Healthy conversations don’t make you feel gross.**\n\nThey don’t leave you rattled, reactive, or self-doubting.\n\nThey don’t flatten all of the nuance into an abstract point or pit us against each other in a weird flex-off.\n\nThey invite participation. They build. They move forward like a good improv scene — like a “yes, and…” that encourages more voices, more learning, and more possibility.\n\nEvery good designer knows that solving any complex problem means you have to _identify_ it first.\n\nSo that’s what this is. A simple ID exercise.\n\nA catalog of our worst impulses — not to shame, but to offer better, healthier alternatives.\n\nI’m certain that most of what we’re doing is unconscious and unintended by good-hearted people. But that’s just the point, isn’t it?\n\nBy surfacing the patterns in how we talk about AI — often with fear, status anxiety, and noise — I’m hoping we can grow past this weird liminal phase.\n\nNot heaven. Not hell. Just a low-level echo chamber where every LinkedIn post feels simultaneously urgent, predictable, and… exhausting.\n\nSo, what I’m proposing is a bit of a detox from our usual way of talking.\n\nAnd I’m suggesting some healthy alternatives instead.\n\nDesigned by Mike Schindler (mschindler.com)\n\n## ❌ FOMO\n\n> _“Everyone’s ahead of me. I need to catch up or I’ll be obsolete.”_\n\nThis is the dark hum of the current discourse. You see it between the lines of almost every AI post. The implication is simple. _If you’re not prompt-engineering throughout your entire design process, you’re already behind._\n\nSimple fear of missing out.\n\nIt’s not just anxiety — it’s a quiet arms race of self-erasure, where speed takes up all the oxygen in the room and thoughtful reflection somehow feels like a liability.\n\n### 🌱 A Healthier Way: Curiosity-Driven Learning\n\nThe truth is, [the cheese is _always_ moving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F).\n\nThat’s the nature of knowledge work. Change isn’t a moment — it’s our constant state of being.\n\nAs [Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker) famously warned:\n\n> “The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence — it is to act with yesterday’s logic.”\n\nAt the rate we’re going, every year, every month, even every week is more complex than the last. The pace won’t slow down — but the way we show up to each day _can_.\n\nSo what if we saw this moment not as an exercise in sprint conditioning, but as an invitation to learn?\n\nLeading with curiosity reframes the AI shift from _“What am I missing?”_ to _“What can I explore that aligns with my values, my practice, and the people I serve?”_\n\nIt puts the designer back in the loop — not as a bottleneck, but as a rational and strategic human-centered synthesizer.\n\nNot optimizing just for speed, but for shared understanding.\n\n## ❌ Gaslighting\n\n> _“Design is dead. AI has already replaced you. Stop trying.”_\n\nThe velocity of change we’re experiencing has created a kind of virtual chasm in our shared reality. It’s no wonder the discourse has taken on a theatrical tone — half prediction, half panic.\n\nEnter [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting).\n\nThat’s when the dread warriors, armed with half-baked provocations and usually a touch of _mansplaining_, sow doubt under the guise of thought leadership. Their goal isn’t clarity or education — it’s status.\n\nIf you’ve started to question your own sanity, that’s an important clue and here’s what to tell yourself. You’re probably still grounded. The gaslighters just want you to think otherwise.\n\nThis isn’t just annoying. It’s manipulative. It’s pervasive. And it’s all too common in our professional and political atmospheres.\n\nBut here’s the thing. We don’t have to accept their reality as our fate.\n\nEven if only a fraction of what they say is true, the rest is still noise — and we have the right to filter for our own peace of mind.\n\n### 🌱 A Healthier Way: Critical Perspective\n\nI go by a simple rule of thumb.\n\nYour experience is not my experience.\n\nInstead of questioning if every move we make relative to our peers or competitors is correct or not, why don’t we just recognize each other as unique individuals, all in our respective places in work and in life?\n\nChances are the gaslighters live in a bubble filled with their own innate [Blue Velvet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Booth_(Blue_Velvet)) gas. Let them suck it all in while you stay sane.\n\n## ❌ Clickbait\n\n> _“AI will replace UX.” or “No-code is the end of design.”_\n\nWe’ve all seen the headlines. We’ve all clicked the links.\n\nThis daily apocalypse is a new kind of engagement economy. Let’s call it **Hysteria-as-a-Service**. Crafted by people who are either too clever by half or too thoughtless by whole.\n\nThese proclamations don’t predict the future — they provoke the present.\n\nThey divide us into two groups. The doomed and the destined. The washed and the winners.\n\nIt’s narrative bait for our most primitive instincts.\n\nShame on them for leading us with these clicks.\n\nClick again, and shame on us — and Shamu for that matter… (sorry, that was a shame spiral).\n\nI get it. We’re visceral beings. We sat through eight seasons of _Game of Thrones_ because [the pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Is_Coming) blew up everything we thought we knew about the rules of television— and the rest of the show kept us locked in with intermittent sex, violence, and surprise beheadings.\n\nThe internet does the same thing, only without the sets or the CGI dragons. It thrives on the tease. But unlike Westeros, there’s rarely any payoff.\n\nEvery article promising _“The Death of Design Is Coming Sooner Than You Think”_ or _“Why I’m Leaving UX (and You Should Too)”_ echoes in a sea of sameness. The volume is high, but the depth is shallow.\n\n### 🌱 A Healthier Way: Nuanced Storytelling\n\nThe alternative is simple, but not easy. We have to value substance over spectacle.\n\nInstead of indulging our",
