It’s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them.\n\nResumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn’t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less. We've said before that spending a lot of time on your resume is a fool's errand, but if you’re going to do _something_ to it, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return.

The sequel is fittingly called _Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview_.\n\nWe cover everything you need to know for today's tougher technical interviews and hiring climate.

At interviewing.io, my team and I have been trying to make hiring meritocratic for the last decade.\n\nI’ll also be the first to admit that DEI is ideologically flawed because of its emphasis on race and gender-based outcomes and its insistence on equality of those outcomes. In the last decade, we've seen a lot of bad stuff done in the name of DEI, firsthand. I'll talk about those in this post.\n\nBut all the recent pro-meritocracy, anti-DEI rhetoric is bad. Yelling “Meritocracy!” as if it’s a fait accompli is just as harmful as the worst parts of DEI. I’d even go so far to say that the DEI movement has done more for meritocracy than the loud pro-meritocracy movement is doing right now.\n\nI’m delighted that “meritocracy” is no longer a dirty word. But, just saying it isn’t enough. We have to change our hiring practices. We need to stop using meritocracy as a shield to preserve the status quo.\n\nIn this post, I talk about the flaws of DEI, the false promise of meritocracy, and what to do to actually make hiring meritocratic and fair.\n\nBy Aline Lerner | Published:\n\n[Read more >](https://interviewing.io/blog/i-love-meritocracy-but-all-the-recent-anti-dei-rhetoric-is-bad)\n\n[How well do LeetCode ratings predict interview performance?

It’s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them. Resumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn’t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less. We've said before that spending a lot of time on your resume is a fool's errand, but if you’re going to do _something_ to it, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return.

At interviewing.io, my team and I have been trying to make hiring meritocratic for the last decade. I’ll also be the first to admit that DEI is ideologically flawed because of its emphasis on race and gender-based outcomes and its insistence on equality of those outcomes. In the last decade, we've seen a lot of bad stuff done in the name of DEI, firsthand. I'll talk about those in this post. But all the recent pro-meritocracy, anti-DEI rhetoric is bad. Yelling “Meritocracy!” as if it’s a fait accompli is just as harmful as the worst parts of DEI. I’d even go so far to say that the DEI movement has done more for meritocracy than the loud pro-meritocracy movement is doing right now. I’m delighted that “meritocracy” is no longer a dirty word. But, just saying it isn’t enough. We have to change our hiring practices. We need to stop using meritocracy as a shield to preserve the status quo.

Here, you can get a lens into the kinds of questions you'd encounter at top companies and get comfortable with answering them in a low-pressure, anonymous setting.\n\n  \n\nBeyond that, interviewing here can be a great way to get your foot in the door at top companies. When you do well in practice, you’ll get access to our jobs portal, and there you can get warm intros to hiring decision-makers.\n\n  \n\nIn other words, you can get interviews at top companies without ever touching your resume, applying, haranguing your friends for referrals, or talking to recruiters.\n\nThere are lots of interview sites out there, and many are cheaper. Why should I choose interviewing.io?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nWe have the best, most experienced interviewers on the market, full stop. We’ve spent 9 years honing both our selection process for interviewers and the metrics by which we evaluate interviewer performance. Here’s how it works.\n\nAnyone who wants to be an interviewer on our platform has to pass an intense screening process based on a mix of experience, credentials, and performance. We require that all of our interviewers:\n\n*   Have worked at FAANG or FAANG-adjacent companies (a short list comprised of companies like Stripe, OpenAI, Uber, Dropbox, and some others).\n*   Have at least 4 years of experience (though our average interviewer has over 8 years)\n*   Have conducted at least 20 interviews on behalf of the FAANG or FAANG-adjacent company\n\nThen:\n\n*   We ask them to do 2 trial interviews. Many interviewers, even if they have great credentials, don’t get past this stage because we are ruthless in our standards for great interviewee experience.\n*   Even if they do very well in their trial interviews, for the remainder of their time on our platform, we are tracking two metrics for every interviewer ([we wrote in detail about these two metrics previously](https://interviewing.io/blog/our-business-depends-on-having-the-best-interviewers-so-we-built-an-interviewer-rating-system-and-you-can-too)\n    ).\n\n**We have a very long waitlist of interviewers as a result. We are very, very picky because we are the best in the business at this, and we want it to stay that way.**\n\nHow much experience should I have? Is it alright if I haven’t interviewed much before?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nFor now, you’ll probably get the most value out of interviewing.io if you’ve already done a number of technical interviews and know exactly what to expect. If you haven’t yet, you might want to work some problems on your own first to get comfortable with the format. If you need a place to start, we heartily recommend **[Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/?utm_source=interviewingio&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=interviewingio)\n**. There, you can work algorithmic problems at your own pace and get nice hints as you go.\n\nWhat kind of questions can I expect?\n------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nOur interviews focus on CS fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and systems design. Questions will be similar, both in subject matter and difficulty, to the kinds of questions you’d see in a real technical interview at a top company for a backend or full-stack role.\n\nHow anonymous is this really?\n-----------------------------\n\n  \n\nInterviews have voice but no video, and your interviewer will not have access to any of your info. In other words, how much you reveal is entirely up to you. Moreover, we will never share anything about you or your contact info with anyone without your permission.\n\nCan I get interviewed by someone I work with? Because that'd be awkward.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nNope! We'll make sure you don’t get paired with your coworkers.\n\nHow much do premium interviews cost? What’s your refund policy?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nInterviews start at $225, but the price varies depending on the subject matter and whether you want an interviewer from a specific company. If you’re unhappy with your interview(s), we’ll issue a full refund.\n\nWho will my interviewer be? Can I request someone from a specific company, e.g. \"I have a Google interview coming up and want to practice specifically with a Googler\"?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nYes, absolutely. We have interviewers from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Stripe, Uber, Dropbox, Netflix, LinkedIn, Slack, and a bunch of other top-notch companies.\n\nI want to be an interviewer. What do I need to do?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nAwesome! Send an email to [interviewers@interviewing.io](mailto:interviewers@interviewing.io)\n with a few sentences about you, and we'll get back to you ASAP.\n\nWho are you, and why are you working on this?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nWe’re a small team of engineers in San Francisco who want engineering hiring to not suck. Aline (one of our founders) first got the idea for interviewing.io after realizing that in an engineering resume, pedigree isn't a particularly valuable signal (whereas **[things like typos and grammatical errors are](https://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/)\n)**. To make sure she wasn’t crazy, she showed a bunch of anonymized resumes to recruiters and hiring managers, and it turned out that **[no one could agree on what a good candidate looked like](https://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres-the-data/)\n**. This seemed absurd, given how heavily companies generally rely on pedigree when deciding whom to let in the door.\n\n  \n\nEngineering is supposed to be meritocratic.

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Google interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.\n\n[See available times](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee)\n\n![](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Google’s job interview process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nAll human organizations behave like a metaphor; Google isn’t a sports team, or a family, or an army. It’s a cool grad school. Larry and Sergey set up their offices based on the model of a Stanford campus on purpose. They wanted to create an environment and company culture where people can feel chill enough to talk about anything. In general, Google interviewers tend to be more collaborative than other FAANG interviewers. At Google, the slower you go, the faster you get there.\n\nGoogle has one big, centralized interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on, which means that you will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future team members – Google has a horde of interchangeable technical interviewers who have all been trained on the same process. If you do well, there will be a team matching component at the end.\n\nAt Google, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently, which means you don’t get multiple shots on goal. Not only that, but Google has a limit for how many chances they’ll give you before you’re blocked from interviewing again.\n\nNote that recently, there have been rumblings of Google changing their process to something more decentralized, where a hiring manager chooses you for a team _before_ you interview, nullifying the need for post-onsite team matching. As far as we know, this new model is being tried out right now, but the change hasn’t been adopted company-wide.\n\nGoogle also has rules for candidates who _pass_ their interviews:\n\nGoogle is not results-oriented. They’re process oriented. In other words, they care more about the “How” than the “What”. You’ve heard it before, and it’s true – they don’t need you to get to the optimal solution, but they do need to be impressed by your thought process. Because of this, Google is more attracted to comfort with ambiguity than speed.\n\nOddly, in spite of using a centralized interview process, Google doesn’t have in-depth training for its interviewers; it may surprise some candidates that there’s a larger-than-expected number of bad interviewers at Google.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nGoogle’s technical phone screen is a coding interview that focuses exclusively on data structures and algorithms questions. Your interviewer will ask you to write code to solve a specific problem.\n\nOne idiosyncratic aspect of Google’s process is their insistence on using Google docs for writing code (versus other companies which tend to use tools like CoderPad). This can be a bit jarring for those of us who are used to writing code in an IDE that does things like auto-indentation, auto-complete, syntax highlighting, adding missing parentheses or brackets etc. Despite not using an IDE, your interviewer will expect you to produce syntactically correct code. This is really hard.\n\nThat said, more recently, Google has started interviewing using an internal tool with syntax highlighting, indentation and brackets completion. Whether you get to use it or not depends on your geography.\n\n### Step 2.5: (In some cases) Another technical phone screen\n\nThe second phone screen happens only if the first one did not produce enough signal to move forward. Perhaps you didn’t communicate your thought process well enough, your code wasn’t of good enough quality, or you weren’t fast enough – but it’ll be only one of these – if you struggled with two or all three, most likely you aren’t moving forward.\n\nIf you get a second phone screen it will be very similar to the first in terms of structure and content.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe Google onsite usually includes 4-6 rounds. Recently, there have been some internal experiments with the format, but generally the rounds are primarily coding, and secondarily system design. Some candidates get a single behavioral round, and others get to skip it.\n\nThe more experience you have, the higher proportion of system design and domain-specific questions you can expect to be asked.\n\n“You can interview three times in 5 years. If you fail all three times then you can’t interview at Google again: you’re blocked.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“If you pass Google’s onsite, and end up not taking the offer, your “passing of the onsite '' is good for about a year. And if you choose to re-engage in that time, the process varies widely. Usually you can skip the phone interview. Most times you have to do the full or partial onsite. If you choose to re-engage, tell their recruiters ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get as many steps skipped as you can.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“There is one thing that always bothered me about the Google interview process. And it's something that a lot of candidates don’t realize. There are a lot of bad interviewers at Google. Mostly because there are a lot of highly talented people who think they know everything.\n\nI was the interviewer for the third interview round at in-person onsite. And I saw the candidate was there by himself; the second interviewer wasn’t there. The candidate was alone because the second interviewer got frustrated – they thought the candidate wasn’t worth the time for an onsite, so they left early.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Google is more likely than Facebook to design questions on purpose to be tricky. At Google, sometimes this is intentionally disguising technical questions to look like X but they’re really Y. And other times at Google, it’s designing a technical question such that if a candidate doesn’t ask a particular question they likely won’t get the answer.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Interviewer Who Worked at Google and Facebook\n\nBefore your Google interview, you should practice in Google docs so you don’t forget to close parentheses or indent your code.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you do get scheduled for a second phone screen, push your recruiter to give you detailed feedback so you can do better the second time – nothing beats knowing _exactly_ where you need to improve. You probably won’t get a response, but if you do it’s a large boost to your prep.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nGoogle’s interview types in detail\n----------------------------------\n\nAs we mentioned above, Google is process-oriented rather than results-oriented. As such, communication during coding and system design rounds is more important at Google than the end result.\n\n### Coding\n\n**The most important rounds at Google are coding. In fact, Google is the only FAANG company that considers coding to be more important than system design**. Google’s coding rounds are about complexity more than speed. Their interviewers are allowed to ask anything they want, so it's more likely you might get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nGoogle interviewers are more likely than any other FAANG company to purposefully design a question so it tricks candidates. For example, they’ll disguise a question to look like it’s Three Sum, but that’s a red herring – it’s not a Three Sum problem. It just looks like one.\n\nA lot of what you’ll see in the onsite coding mirrors what you saw in the technical phone screen. During the onsite, you may see your interviewer layer more complexity on top of questions – they’ll design a question where they plan for you to get to the solution, then when you do they’ll move the goalposts and say something like: “Remember that assumption we made earlier about \\[X thing\\]? Let’s remove that. How would that change your approach?”\n\nEven though they can ask whatever they want, Google interviewers have a question bank too, but the bank is much much bigger than Facebook’s bank and, like Facebook’s bank, it’s community maintained. Some interviewers never deviate from the bank, and others don’t touch it, preferring instead to formulate their own unique questions..\n\nThis speaks to Google rewarding the “how” (aka “how a candidate got there”) or their thought processes. It also speaks to Google rewarding comfort with ambiguity. Other FAANGs have specific niche topics they love hearing and talking about (such as “performance” at Amazon), but Google is more abstract. Google might love speaking about and asking about ambiguity more than any other FAANG.\n\nFinally, Google’s coding questions are never practical. They are always theoretical. They will never ask you to pull up your own environment and write a program. They will also never ask you to take a solution to a coding problem and apply it to a real world scenario. When prepping for Google, only practice theoretical questions.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Google’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Google coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google#google-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThe second most important onsite interview type at Google is system design. Again, they are allowed to ask anything they want, so don’t be scared off if you get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nHigh-level and low-level system design questions are both likely. Some examples include:\n\n*   Design a load balancer\n*   Design Facebook Messenger\n*   Design an auth platform\n\nGoogle system design interviewers also tend to design problems that include linchpin questions. These are questions where if you don’t ask about a specific aspect of the problem, you can’t really solve it. For example, an older system design question at Google asked you to set up a service in some foreign country, and in the prompt, the interviewer mentioned that you have a dependency on some third party service.\n\nThe linchpin question to ask: “What’s the service level agreement for that 3rd party service?” If you didn’t ask that (or something like it), then you wouldn’t be able to effectively reason about availability, which you’d need to do in order to do well on the question.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThe least important round at Google is the behavioral round. They have the easiest behavioral screen in FAANG. Plus, you might complete an onsite at Google without a behavioral round because they’re optional. It’s not clear which candidates get them and which don’t. This is another reason to not prep too hard for their behavioral round.\n\nIf you do get some behavioral questions, they might be one of the following:\n\n*   Tell me about a time when you had a colleague who was difficult to work with.\n*   Tell me about a time you received negative feedback.\n*   Tell me about a time you were mentoring a more junior engineer and your feedback wasn’t getting through to them.\n*   If you were going to plan an offsite for the team, how would you do it?\n\nGoogle is also more likely to ask you reflective questions. Most other FAANGs stick to situational questions such as, “Tell me of a time when…”. Those situational questions ask you to describe a past circumstance or scenario you’ve actually experienced and are fairly straightforward to answer. Reflective questions, on the other hand, can be tricky because they’re asking you to reflect on, or speak to, something less concrete, e.g., “What do you think about setting goals?”\n\nThe smart way to answer a reflective question is to re-formulate it, and then answer as if it’s a situational question. So, “What do you think about setting goals” instead becomes,”Talk about a time you used goal-setting as a time management strategy”, which you can now more-easily answer by describing a real experience and outcome, “The last time I set goals…etc”, as opposed to wading into theories about personal agency. “I think goals are cool and important…” might not get high marks.\n\n“At Google, I’ve passed more people that _arrive at the optimal solution without coding it_ than I do people who _arrive at the optimal solution and code it_. The actual code you write is less important than the thought process.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Google is highly unstructured. Everyone can ask whatever they want.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\nTo avoid getting tricked, ask even more questions in Google system design rounds than you normally would.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“To be honest, there was some cultural backlash at Google when they announced that we had to do these behavioral interviews. What that means is you may get an interviewer who has very little interest in conducting this type of interview. Which could go very good or very bad. I have some peers who think this should not be a part of the interview process. So they give everyone the highest marks, pretty much just to eliminate this category from the interview. Google is primarily engineers, and most of the engineers think that this is a bunch of HR BS. So they either just won’t accept any calendar invites they get or they'll just check the boxes.”\n\n### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\nHow Google makes hiring decisions\n---------------------------------\n\nMost of the time, the post-interview feedback process at Google is completely asynchronous, and interviewers don’t meet live to discuss hiring decisions. That’s one reason why interviewing at Google isn’t like interviewing with humans: it’s more akin to interviewing with a machine.\n\nEach interviewer rates candidates on the following seven-point scale: Strong No-Hire, No Hire, Leaning No-Hire, On The Fence, Leaning Hire, Hire, and Strong Hire.\n\nHow this affects candidates is simple: a Strong Hire can get you an offer, but it can also buy you a second chance. If you don’t get an offer, but you get a Strong Hire from one of your interviewers, you might be offered one bonus interview round to decide whether you get an offer or not.\n\nThat said, you don’t need to get a “Strong Hire” to get a second chance. Overall, if you showed enough signal to not-fail but not enough to pass, sometimes they will ask you to do an additional round.\n\nA “Strong No-Hire” bars you from interviewing at Google for some time. Reports vary here, but one of our Google interviewers told us that if you get a Strong No-Hire, you might be frozen out for several years.\n\nIf you passed overall then you will move on to the hiring committee phase.\n\n### Hiring committee review & team matching\n\nGoogle’s hiring committee consists of four to five engineers and engineering managers who have not interviewed you, with the intent of making hiring decisions as objective as possible.\n\nGoing into the hiring committee review, your recruiter will prepare a packet that consists of your resume, any notes from the person who referred you (if you were referred), your recruiter’s notes from their call with you, and all the feedback from your interviewers, from the technical phone screen to the onsite.\n\nWhen the committee meets, they evaluate all the data on you holistically, and they need a consensus in order to decide to make a hire.\n\nOther than hire/no-hire decisions, the hiring committee will also decide on leveling. Ever since COVID and the rise of remote interviewing, we’ve gotten more and more reports from users that they’re being down-leveled at Google. Apparently the rationale is that Google doesn’t feel like they get as much signal from remote interviews as they did from in-person ones, and as such, when they don’t get enough of a signal for a hire but too much good signal for a rejection: they downlevel – when you want to reduce the probability of a false positives for L5… offer L4!\n\nEngineers who are downleveled at Google accept the lower level offer a lot of the time, especially in the current climate. In some extreme cases, we’ve seen engineering managers with 10+ YoE accept an L3 (basically a new grad) offer.\n\nOnce you get past the hiring committee, you will move on to team matching. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. In the ideal case, your recruiter will propose a few teams that are actively looking for someone with your skills, and then you’ll meet with the hiring manager from each team to gauge cultural fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\nThat said, there are rare instances where a candidate will get past the hiring committee but then not find a team that they gel with.\n\nIf you get lucky enough to get a round where you are really excelling, don’t quit while you’re ahead. Keep going. In that round, don’t just strive to win; strive for total domination.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you’re told you’ve passed the onsite, ask if you can submit a more recent copy of your resume. Some Google recruiters will let your new resume be the only resume the Hiring Committee sees. Your resume you submitted for the online application probably wasn’t customized for Google, but what you submit to the hiring committee can be.\n\n#### Resume screening tip\n\n“Getting five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’ is most likely to result in a ‘No Hire’ decision. I have seen many cases where the candidates got five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’, and the recruiter gave them positive feedback too, but the candidate got rejected. In these cases, every person the candidate dealt with directly (the interviewers) were positive, yet the hiring committee (the only people in the process who dealt with the candidate indirectly) rejected the candidate.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\nGoogle coding interview preparation resources\n---------------------------------------------\n\nHere are some tips for preparing for your Google coding interview:\n\n*   Practice in teams; have someone make up a question. Then have them disguise it or plant a red herring in it (for example, purposefully have it look like Three Sum, but it isn’t Three Sum).\n*   Practice with someone who can change the parameters after you’ve solved the main question by saying things like “Remember that assumption X we made earlier. What would happen if we removed that assumption?”\n*   If you see a question online that has been marked as “Asked in a Google interview”, then it is not going to be asked in your interview, period. Google is very good at retiring questions that have been leaked.\n*   Practice without the aid of an editor or IDE: in a Google doc, on a whiteboard, or with pen and paper.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Google content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Google interviewers, long-form solutions to common Google questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Google interviews.\n\n### Google interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Google interviewers on our platform.

Your interviewer will ask you to write code to solve a specific problem.\n\nOne idiosyncratic aspect of Google’s process is their insistence on using Google docs for writing code (versus other companies which tend to use tools like CoderPad). This can be a bit jarring for those of us who are used to writing code in an IDE that does things like auto-indentation, auto-complete, syntax highlighting, adding missing parentheses or brackets etc. Despite not using an IDE, your interviewer will expect you to produce syntactically correct code. This is really hard.\n\nThat said, more recently, Google has started interviewing using an internal tool with syntax highlighting, indentation and brackets completion. Whether you get to use it or not depends on your geography.",

Recently, there have been some internal experiments with the format, but generally the rounds are primarily coding, and secondarily system design. Some candidates get a single behavioral round, and others get to skip it.\n\nThe more experience you have, the higher proportion of system design and domain-specific questions you can expect to be asked.\n\n“You can interview three times in 5 years. If you fail all three times then you can’t interview at Google again: you’re blocked.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“If you pass Google’s onsite, and end up not taking the offer, your “passing of the onsite '' is good for about a year. And if you choose to re-engage in that time, the process varies widely. Usually you can skip the phone interview. Most times you have to do the full or partial onsite. If you choose to re-engage, tell their recruiters ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get as many steps skipped as you can.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“There is one thing that always bothered me about the Google interview process. And it's something that a lot of candidates don’t realize. There are a lot of bad interviewers at Google. Mostly because there are a lot of highly talented people who think they know everything.\n\nI was the interviewer for the third interview round at in-person onsite. And I saw the candidate was there by himself; the second interviewer wasn’t there. The candidate was alone because the second interviewer got frustrated – they thought the candidate wasn’t worth the time for an onsite, so they left early.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Google is more likely than Facebook to design questions on purpose to be tricky. At Google, sometimes this is intentionally disguising technical questions to look like X but they’re really Y. And other times at Google, it’s designing a technical question such that if a candidate doesn’t ask a particular question they likely won’t get the answer.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Interviewer Who Worked at Google and Facebook\n\nBefore your Google interview, you should practice in Google docs so you don’t forget to close parentheses or indent your code.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you do get scheduled for a second phone screen, push your recruiter to give you detailed feedback so you can do better the second time – nothing beats knowing _exactly_ where you need to improve. You probably won’t get a response, but if you do it’s a large boost to your prep.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nGoogle’s interview types in detail\n----------------------------------\n\nAs we mentioned above, Google is process-oriented rather than results-oriented. As such, communication during coding and system design rounds is more important at Google than the end result.",

          "content": "### Coding\n\n**The most important rounds at Google are coding. In fact, Google is the only FAANG company that considers coding to be more important than system design**. Google’s coding rounds are about complexity more than speed. Their interviewers are allowed to ask anything they want, so it's more likely you might get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nGoogle interviewers are more likely than any other FAANG company to purposefully design a question so it tricks candidates. For example, they’ll disguise a question to look like it’s Three Sum, but that’s a red herring – it’s not a Three Sum problem. It just looks like one.\n\nA lot of what you’ll see in the onsite coding mirrors what you saw in the technical phone screen. During the onsite, you may see your interviewer layer more complexity on top of questions – they’ll design a question where they plan for you to get to the solution, then when you do they’ll move the goalposts and say something like: “Remember that assumption we made earlier about \\[X thing\\]? Let’s remove that. How would that change your approach?”\n\nEven though they can ask whatever they want, Google interviewers have a question bank too, but the bank is much much bigger than Facebook’s bank and, like Facebook’s bank, it’s community maintained. Some interviewers never deviate from the bank, and others don’t touch it, preferring instead to formulate their own unique questions..\n\nThis speaks to Google rewarding the “how” (aka “how a candidate got there”) or their thought processes. It also speaks to Google rewarding comfort with ambiguity. Other FAANGs have specific niche topics they love hearing and talking about (such as “performance” at Amazon), but Google is more abstract. Google might love speaking about and asking about ambiguity more than any other FAANG.\n\nFinally, Google’s coding questions are never practical. They are always theoretical. They will never ask you to pull up your own environment and write a program. They will also never ask you to take a solution to a coding problem and apply it to a real world scenario. When prepping for Google, only practice theoretical questions.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Google’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Google coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google#google-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n\" below.",

          "content": "### System design\n\nThe second most important onsite interview type at Google is system design. Again, they are allowed to ask anything they want, so don’t be scared off if you get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nHigh-level and low-level system design questions are both likely. Some examples include:\n\n*   Design a load balancer\n*   Design Facebook Messenger\n*   Design an auth platform\n\nGoogle system design interviewers also tend to design problems that include linchpin questions. These are questions where if you don’t ask about a specific aspect of the problem, you can’t really solve it. For example, an older system design question at Google asked you to set up a service in some foreign country, and in the prompt, the interviewer mentioned that you have a dependency on some third party service.\n\nThe linchpin question to ask: “What’s the service level agreement for that 3rd party service?” If you didn’t ask that (or something like it), then you wouldn’t be able to effectively reason about availability, which you’d need to do in order to do well on the question.",

          "content": "### Behavioral\n\nThe least important round at Google is the behavioral round. They have the easiest behavioral screen in FAANG. Plus, you might complete an onsite at Google without a behavioral round because they’re optional. It’s not clear which candidates get them and which don’t. This is another reason to not prep too hard for their behavioral round.\n\nIf you do get some behavioral questions, they might be one of the following:\n\n*   Tell me about a time when you had a colleague who was difficult to work with.\n*   Tell me about a time you received negative feedback.\n*   Tell me about a time you were mentoring a more junior engineer and your feedback wasn’t getting through to them.\n*   If you were going to plan an offsite for the team, how would you do it?\n\nGoogle is also more likely to ask you reflective questions. Most other FAANGs stick to situational questions such as, “Tell me of a time when…”. Those situational questions ask you to describe a past circumstance or scenario you’ve actually experienced and are fairly straightforward to answer. Reflective questions, on the other hand, can be tricky because they’re asking you to reflect on, or speak to, something less concrete, e.g., “What do you think about setting goals?”\n\nThe smart way to answer a reflective question is to re-formulate it, and then answer as if it’s a situational question. So, “What do you think about setting goals” instead becomes,”Talk about a time you used goal-setting as a time management strategy”, which you can now more-easily answer by describing a real experience and outcome, “The last time I set goals…etc”, as opposed to wading into theories about personal agency. “I think goals are cool and important…” might not get high marks.\n\n“At Google, I’ve passed more people that _arrive at the optimal solution without coding it_ than I do people who _arrive at the optimal solution and code it_. The actual code you write is less important than the thought process.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Google is highly unstructured. Everyone can ask whatever they want.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\nTo avoid getting tricked, ask even more questions in Google system design rounds than you normally would.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“To be honest, there was some cultural backlash at Google when they announced that we had to do these behavioral interviews. What that means is you may get an interviewer who has very little interest in conducting this type of interview. Which could go very good or very bad. I have some peers who think this should not be a part of the interview process. So they give everyone the highest marks, pretty much just to eliminate this category from the interview. Google is primarily engineers, and most of the engineers think that this is a bunch of HR BS. So they either just won’t accept any calendar invites they get or they'll just check the boxes.”",

That’s one reason why interviewing at Google isn’t like interviewing with humans: it’s more akin to interviewing with a machine.\n\nEach interviewer rates candidates on the following seven-point scale: Strong No-Hire, No Hire, Leaning No-Hire, On The Fence, Leaning Hire, Hire, and Strong Hire.\n\nHow this affects candidates is simple: a Strong Hire can get you an offer, but it can also buy you a second chance. If you don’t get an offer, but you get a Strong Hire from one of your interviewers, you might be offered one bonus interview round to decide whether you get an offer or not.\n\nThat said, you don’t need to get a “Strong Hire” to get a second chance. Overall, if you showed enough signal to not-fail but not enough to pass, sometimes they will ask you to do an additional round.\n\nA “Strong No-Hire” bars you from interviewing at Google for some time. Reports vary here, but one of our Google interviewers told us that if you get a Strong No-Hire, you might be frozen out for several years.\n\nIf you passed overall then you will move on to the hiring committee phase.",

          "content": "### Hiring committee review & team matching\n\nGoogle’s hiring committee consists of four to five engineers and engineering managers who have not interviewed you, with the intent of making hiring decisions as objective as possible.\n\nGoing into the hiring committee review, your recruiter will prepare a packet that consists of your resume, any notes from the person who referred you (if you were referred), your recruiter’s notes from their call with you, and all the feedback from your interviewers, from the technical phone screen to the onsite.\n\nWhen the committee meets, they evaluate all the data on you holistically, and they need a consensus in order to decide to make a hire.\n\nOther than hire/no-hire decisions, the hiring committee will also decide on leveling. Ever since COVID and the rise of remote interviewing, we’ve gotten more and more reports from users that they’re being down-leveled at Google. Apparently the rationale is that Google doesn’t feel like they get as much signal from remote interviews as they did from in-person ones, and as such, when they don’t get enough of a signal for a hire but too much good signal for a rejection: they downlevel – when you want to reduce the probability of a false positives for L5… offer L4!\n\nEngineers who are downleveled at Google accept the lower level offer a lot of the time, especially in the current climate. In some extreme cases, we’ve seen engineering managers with 10+ YoE accept an L3 (basically a new grad) offer.\n\nOnce you get past the hiring committee, you will move on to team matching. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. In the ideal case, your recruiter will propose a few teams that are actively looking for someone with your skills, and then you’ll meet with the hiring manager from each team to gauge cultural fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\nThat said, there are rare instances where a candidate will get past the hiring committee but then not find a team that they gel with.\n\nIf you get lucky enough to get a round where you are really excelling, don’t quit while you’re ahead. Keep going. In that round, don’t just strive to win; strive for total domination.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you’re told you’ve passed the onsite, ask if you can submit a more recent copy of your resume. Some Google recruiters will let your new resume be the only resume the Hiring Committee sees. Your resume you submitted for the online application probably wasn’t customized for Google, but what you submit to the hiring committee can be.\n\n#### Resume screening tip\n\n“Getting five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’ is most likely to result in a ‘No Hire’ decision. I have seen many cases where the candidates got five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’, and the recruiter gave them positive feedback too, but the candidate got rejected. In these cases, every person the candidate dealt with directly (the interviewers) were positive, yet the hiring committee (the only people in the process who dealt with the candidate indirectly) rejected the candidate.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\nGoogle coding interview preparation resources\n---------------------------------------------\n\nHere are some tips for preparing for your Google coding interview:\n\n*   Practice in teams; have someone make up a question. Then have them disguise it or plant a red herring in it (for example, purposefully have it look like Three Sum, but it isn’t Three Sum).\n*   Practice with someone who can change the parameters after you’ve solved the main question by saying things like “Remember that assumption X we made earlier. What would happen if we removed that assumption?”\n*   If you see a question online that has been marked as “Asked in a Google interview”, then it is not going to be asked in your interview, period. Google is very good at retiring questions that have been leaked.\n*   Practice without the aid of an editor or IDE: in a Google doc, on a whiteboard, or with pen and paper.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Google content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Google interviewers, long-form solutions to common Google questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Google interviews.",

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Meta interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.\n\n[See available times](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee)\n\n![](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Meta’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMeta interviewers are guided by the company’s current motto: move fast. All human groups have a metaphor they operate from. Meta isn’t a family or an army. They’re a well-structured Formula 1 team; they spend a lot of effort to put safeguards in place, and then they go pedal to the metal. At Meta, speed wins.\n\nAt Meta, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently like you can at some other tech companies. You get one shot on goal every ~3 to 6 months, depending on performance.\n\n“If you pass Meta’s onsite, but don’t take the offer your status of ‘passed onsite’ is valid for a year. If you don’t take their offer and then choose to re-engage within that year, tell their recruiter ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get steps skipped because you usually can.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\nWhen interviewing at Meta, listen closely to the subtle clues and hints your interviewer gives you. Meta is the only FAANG where you can’t become an interviewer unless you give good hints.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the previous section called [“A note about recruiter calls”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n. Also [read our guide to negotiating with Meta](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta)\n. It starts at the recruiter call.\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nMeta's technical phone screen is a 45-minute coding interview that focuses on data structures and algorithms.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview, your interviewer will ask you a question or two about your resume and recent work that you've done. This portion will take 5 minutes, and how you answer these questions doesn't meaningfully factor into the interview's outcome - they are just meant to break the ice and get you talking. The part that matters is the technical portion.\n\nAfter the intro portion, your interviewer will ask you two coding questions, and they expect you to get through both in 35 minutes. These questions will be LeetCode easy or medium difficulty.\n\nMeta’s technical phone screens are conducted in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/)\n. If you've never used it, you may want to [play around in their sandbox](https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox?_ga=2.197732077.314108963.1684799836-1650489622.1682112501&_gl=1*ijwnf5*_ga*MTY1MDQ4OTYyMi4xNjgyMTEyNTAx*_ga_XBQ5N5CE2N*MTY4NDc5OTgzNi40LjEuMTY4NDgwMDAzMi4xNC4wLjA.)\n and get familiar with their environment before your real interview. One specific thing about Meta's way of using CoderPad is that during the interview, they'll have code execution turned off - if you've used it before and are accustomed to testing your code during the interview by running it, you'll need to practice not being able to.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThe typical Meta onsite will consist of the following:\n\n*   At least two coding interviews\n*   Two system design OR product design interviews\n*   One behavioral interview\n\n#### Alternate Process for E6 engineers\n\nThe process for E6 engineers, as outlined in the diagram above, is slightly different. There will be a Leadership Assessment interview after the Technical Screen. In this interview, the following topics might be covered:\n\n*   Your current role, responsibility, and scope\n*   Cross-functional partnerships\n*   Situations regarding conflict resolution\n*   Solution skills\n*   How to drive results\n\nThe onsite for E6 engineers will also be different. You should only get one coding round, one architecture round, one design round and then a behavioral round.\n\nTypes of Meta interviews and what to expect\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThere are four main types of interviews you’re going to encounter when you apply for an engineering job at Meta – coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and either a system design or product design interview. Here’s what to expect during each of these rounds of interviews.\n\n### Coding interview\n\nMeta's process is highly standardized, so coding interview questions and themes tend to repeat. Coding questions are pre-approved, but that doesn’t mean the interviewers have no freedom.\n\n“Meta gives you the questions to ask or modify. But they don't tell you the answers in their interviewing wiki. And they let you design the path of the question: you get to ask your own twists and turns.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“There’s some variance with the interviewer, but usually there are 20 mins per question, and the questions are simple. They want you to get the algorithm fast, and implement the basic solution. The kind of bugs that can be acceptable are empty input, and out of scope inputs like empty array/null. But an incomplete algorithm at Meta usually doesn’t cut it. They want you to get to it and get to it quickly, and you can sacrifice making a little bit of a mess along the way.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“I think there is a rule that during the programming interview, interviewers have to ask two questions. And the questions have to be balanced. The first is more like a juicy question testing problem solving skills and you as the interviewer can permit some bugs in the implementation. The second will be easy from the algorithmic point of view but the goal is to assess how much the candidate can write debugless code and test this code perfectly. And if a candidate fails to solve both problems, even if they somewhat shine during one problem: it will be ‘No Hire’.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\nIt's not that bugs are encouraged, it’s that they're the only company that's top-down directive is: sometimes, in certain rounds, bugs are okay. No other company does that. Meta relaxes the need for bug-free code so that candidates can code faster.\n\nFinally, Meta doesn’t ask dynamic programming questions and, in fact, those questions are banned.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Meta’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Meta coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook#facebook-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n\" below.\n\n### System design OR product design interview\n\nMeta hires two types (on paper) of backend engineers: System Generalists and Product Generalists. System generalists get a system design interview, and product generalists get the confusingly named product design interview (in most other contexts, product design refers to UI/UX).\n\nWhich of these interviews you get is determined by your recruiter, based on your experience. If you have worked on a lot of product features, then you get a product design interview. If you have worked on high-scale distributed systems, then you get system design.\n\nThe product design interview at Meta is similar to the system design interview but with some key differences:\n\n*   System design focuses more on high level architecture and scale, while product design focuses more on interactions between services. For example, the expectations for API design in system design interviews is just high level arguments/data passed, whereas product design focuses more on the details, i.e., a more comprehensive list of arguments and response structure.\n*   Product design focuses more on how and what data flows through the entire system, between each service.\n*   Data models are weighted much higher in the product design interview than in system design. The expectation is to be more thorough and detailed.\n\nTake a look at this video, by Meta, about the difference between these two interview types:\n\n“Product design is less databases, more data flow, more time spent on details of the API (e.g. parameters that will pass). System design is more databases, less API details, and more about scaling.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Many people think Meta only asks high level system design questions like ‘Design Twitter’ or ‘Design Meta Feed.’ But that’s not the case. They also ask low level questions. In E6 or above interviews, you will most likely be asked ‘Design Redis’, or ‘Design Kafka’, or ‘Design Memcached.’ I’d even seen rare occasions where E5 candidates would be asked low-level system design questions; low-level questions are less common in rounds for E5 and below.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“You have to ask about back of the envelope estimations. A lot of senior engineers hate to do that. I hate to do that as well. It’s a waste of time. When I do the ‘There is a rule that I have to do this. But there is no point in doing this. Let’s spend 5 minutes talking about real system design. Let’s assume we have to scale our system from 0 to Google level and therefore estimations are just a waste of time.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\nAsk your interviewer: “Do you want to spend a few minutes on estimations? I’m okay with skipping it, but if you need to see it, then let’s do it. If we skipped it, one thing that might be a more interesting conversation would be spending a few minutes on how to scale this system.’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you don’t know what to talk about in a E5 Meta system design round, talk about user experience. Go on about two choices you could make, then explain in depth the one preferred because it’d be a better user experience.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIt’s also common for Meta interviewers to ask you to walk them through a system you’ve worked on in the past, which is known as a reverse system design interview.\n\n### Behavioral interview\n\nUnlike technical questions, behavioral questions at Meta are not standardized: interviewers can ask you whatever they want. Behavioral rounds are of medium/low importance at Meta; they’re less important than technical interview rounds, but they do carry some weight. For the best summary of what to expect in a Meta behavioral interview, read this [blog post by a former Meta engineering manager](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-software-engineering-behavioral-interviews-are-evaluated-meta)\n – in it he describes _exactly_ how behavioral interviews at Meta are evaluated and also includes a bunch of sample questions.\n\nHere is a list of questions to get you started. Read the post to get examples of good answers (split out by the candidate’s seniority level!)\n\n*   “What project are you most proud of and why?”\n*   “Tell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.”\n*   “Tell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.”\n*   “Tell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.”\n*   “Tell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project.”\n*   “Tell me about a time a project took longer as expected.”\n*   “Tell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.”\n*   “Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.”\n*   “Tell me about a situation where two teams couldn’t agree on a path forward.”\n*   “Describe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.”\n*   “Tell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer”\n*   “Tell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.”\n\nFinally, if you are applying for E5 and above make sure to have a couple of projects that lasted longer than one quarter – if all your examples are of smaller initiatives, your interviewer may walk away with the impression that you can’t handle complex projects. Also, remember to quantify the impact that you made by sharing specific metrics.\n\nHow Meta makes hiring decisions\n-------------------------------\n\nMeta’s candidate review and feedback process is usually completely asynchronous. Sometimes, they’ll do a live debrief but it’s rare. This means there’s a low likelihood for an interviewer to “fight” for a candidate. Socially influencing interviewers won’t go very far here.\n\nMeta is also the only FAANG that asks interviewers for a confidence score when filling out post-onsite feedback forms. As a result, the process at Meta can be more forgiving on failed rounds because a lower confidence score means a failed round carries less weight. Also, Meta is the only FAANG that directly asks interviewers about downleveling.\n\n“Coding is used to decide ‘Should we hire this person?’ System and product design is used to decide ‘How should we level this person?’\n\nFor coding interviews, the interviewer says a binary score first: ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’. Then in the comments, they say how confident they are in that binary score. The ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ is an official metric, but the confidence score is not.\n\nFor system/product design, the interviewer gives the ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ first. Then they say if the candidate should be considered for another level.\n\nSo the final decision could be like: ‘No Hire’ for E5 with low confidence. ‘Hire’ for E4 with high confidence.\"\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\nIn cases where the hiring panel is hung, it’s possible they may request one more follow-up interview to help them get more signal.\n\n“Interview feedback is discussed primarily by the system design and behavioral interviewers, and those are the interviewers who have the most say regarding both the hire decision and a candidate’s level. If interviewers don’t feel like they got enough signal and the candidate ends up being on the fence, the recruiter will push for an additional round. Indicative hint: If you have an additional follow-up interview, your interviewers were probably split.\"\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“At Staff level and above, it’s a mandate that candidates can’t get hired if they don’t pass both system design rounds.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“For E6 and above candidates, if you fail one system design round but do well in the other rounds, you can get a mulligan. They can let you retake one system design round. But the same isn’t true for behavioral: if you fail there’s no mulligan. If you fail the behavioral round, it will be ‘No Hire.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n'Team matching, offers, and “Bootcamp”'\n---------------------------------------\n\nMeta made some changes to their process in 2023. Before, unlike at other FAANGs, you'd generally accept an offer before knowing with which team you'd end up on. Then you'd do a 6 week “Bootcamp”, where you'd be trained on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems. After the bootcamp, there would be a 2 week team-matching period.\n\nNow, after you finish the onsite, you jump straight to the team matching process. Team matching now happens BEFORE you get an offer, and offers are contingent on team matching completely successfully.\n\nYou'll talk with hiring managers from a number of teams to gauge fit and chemistry: we've heard that sometimes it's a handful, and sometimes it's over 10.\n\nAfter your team matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in.\n\nOnce you make your choice, your recruiter will officially make an offer, and you'll usually have just a few days to make your decision. We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company.\n\nOne other key difference between Meta's new process and the old one is what happens during Bootcamp. Historically, Bootcamp took 6 weeks, and in addition to training new hires on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems, there'd be a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching component.\n\nBootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter - 2-4 weeks, and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers will continue to ramp up on their specific teams.\n\nThe team matching process is a bit like speed dating. You meet with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\n“When the market is good, you can talk to 20 different teams at the same time.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\nThere are exceptions – some people with niche skills may get hired for a specific team before they start Bootcamp, but they still have to do the bootcamp period, just not the team-matching part afterwards.\n\nMeta coding interview preparation resources\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Meta content for you!

Coding questions are pre-approved, but that doesn’t mean the interviewers have no freedom.\n\n“Meta gives you the questions to ask or modify. But they don't tell you the answers in their interviewing wiki. And they let you design the path of the question: you get to ask your own twists and turns.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“There’s some variance with the interviewer, but usually there are 20 mins per question, and the questions are simple. They want you to get the algorithm fast, and implement the basic solution. The kind of bugs that can be acceptable are empty input, and out of scope inputs like empty array/null. But an incomplete algorithm at Meta usually doesn’t cut it. They want you to get to it and get to it quickly, and you can sacrifice making a little bit of a mess along the way.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“I think there is a rule that during the programming interview, interviewers have to ask two questions. And the questions have to be balanced. The first is more like a juicy question testing problem solving skills and you as the interviewer can permit some bugs in the implementation. The second will be easy from the algorithmic point of view but the goal is to assess how much the candidate can write debugless code and test this code perfectly. And if a candidate fails to solve both problems, even if they somewhat shine during one problem: it will be ‘No Hire’.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\nIt's not that bugs are encouraged, it’s that they're the only company that's top-down directive is: sometimes, in certain rounds, bugs are okay. No other company does that. Meta relaxes the need for bug-free code so that candidates can code faster.\n\nFinally, Meta doesn’t ask dynamic programming questions and, in fact, those questions are banned.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Meta’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Meta coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook#facebook-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n\" below.",

          "content": "### System design OR product design interview\n\nMeta hires two types (on paper) of backend engineers: System Generalists and Product Generalists. System generalists get a system design interview, and product generalists get the confusingly named product design interview (in most other contexts, product design refers to UI/UX).\n\nWhich of these interviews you get is determined by your recruiter, based on your experience. If you have worked on a lot of product features, then you get a product design interview. If you have worked on high-scale distributed systems, then you get system design.\n\nThe product design interview at Meta is similar to the system design interview but with some key differences:\n\n*   System design focuses more on high level architecture and scale, while product design focuses more on interactions between services. For example, the expectations for API design in system design interviews is just high level arguments/data passed, whereas product design focuses more on the details, i.e., a more comprehensive list of arguments and response structure.\n*   Product design focuses more on how and what data flows through the entire system, between each service.\n*   Data models are weighted much higher in the product design interview than in system design. The expectation is to be more thorough and detailed.\n\nTake a look at this video, by Meta, about the difference between these two interview types:\n\n“Product design is less databases, more data flow, more time spent on details of the API (e.g. parameters that will pass). System design is more databases, less API details, and more about scaling.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Many people think Meta only asks high level system design questions like ‘Design Twitter’ or ‘Design Meta Feed.’ But that’s not the case. They also ask low level questions. In E6 or above interviews, you will most likely be asked ‘Design Redis’, or ‘Design Kafka’, or ‘Design Memcached.’ I’d even seen rare occasions where E5 candidates would be asked low-level system design questions; low-level questions are less common in rounds for E5 and below.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“You have to ask about back of the envelope estimations. A lot of senior engineers hate to do that. I hate to do that as well. It’s a waste of time. When I do the ‘There is a rule that I have to do this. But there is no point in doing this. Let’s spend 5 minutes talking about real system design. Let’s assume we have to scale our system from 0 to Google level and therefore estimations are just a waste of time.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\nAsk your interviewer: “Do you want to spend a few minutes on estimations? I’m okay with skipping it, but if you need to see it, then let’s do it. If we skipped it, one thing that might be a more interesting conversation would be spending a few minutes on how to scale this system.’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you don’t know what to talk about in a E5 Meta system design round, talk about user experience. Go on about two choices you could make, then explain in depth the one preferred because it’d be a better user experience.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIt’s also common for Meta interviewers to ask you to walk them through a system you’ve worked on in the past, which is known as a reverse system design interview.",

          "content": "### Behavioral interview Unlike technical questions, behavioral questions at Meta are not standardized: interviewers can ask you whatever they want. Behavioral rounds are of medium/low importance at Meta; they’re less important than technical interview rounds, but they do carry some weight. For the best summary of what to expect in a Meta behavioral interview, read this [blog post by a former Meta engineering manager](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-software-engineering-behavioral-interviews-are-evaluated-meta) – in it he describes _exactly_ how behavioral interviews at Meta are evaluated and also includes a bunch of sample questions. Here is a list of questions to get you started. Read the post to get examples of good answers (split out by the candidate’s seniority level!) * “What project are you most proud of and why?” * “Tell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.” * “Tell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.” * “Tell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.” * “Tell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project.” * “Tell me about a time a project took longer as expected.” * “Tell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.” * “Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.” * “Tell me about a situation where two teams couldn’t agree on a path forward.” * “Describe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.” * “Tell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer” * “Tell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.” Finally, if you are applying for E5 and above make sure to have a couple of projects that lasted longer than one quarter – if all your examples are of smaller initiatives, your interviewer may walk away with the impression that you can’t handle complex projects. Also, remember to quantify the impact that you made by sharing specific metrics. How Meta makes hiring decisions ------------------------------- Meta’s candidate review and feedback process is usually completely asynchronous. Sometimes, they’ll do a live debrief but it’s rare. This means there’s a low likelihood for an interviewer to “fight” for a candidate. Socially influencing interviewers won’t go very far here. Meta is also the only FAANG that asks interviewers for a confidence score when filling out post-onsite feedback forms. As a result, the process at Meta can be more forgiving on failed rounds because a lower confidence score means a failed round carries less weight. Also, Meta is the only FAANG that directly asks interviewers about downleveling. “Coding is used to decide ‘Should we hire this person?’ System and product design is used to decide ‘How should we level this person?’ For coding interviews, the interviewer says a binary score first: ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’. Then in the comments, they say how confident they are in that binary score. The ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ is an official metric, but the confidence score is not. For system/product design, the interviewer gives the ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ first. Then they say if the candidate should be considered for another level. So the final decision could be like: ‘No Hire’ for E5 with low confidence. ‘Hire’ for E4 with high confidence.\" #### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer In cases where the hiring panel is hung, it’s possible they may request one more follow-up interview to help them get more signal. “Interview feedback is discussed primarily by the system design and behavioral interviewers, and those are the interviewers who have the most say regarding both the hire decision and a candidate’s level. If interviewers don’t feel like they got enough signal and the candidate ends up being on the fence, the recruiter will push for an additional round. Indicative hint: If you have an additional follow-up interview, your interviewers were probably split.\" #### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer “At Staff level and above, it’s a mandate that candidates can’t get hired if they don’t pass both system design rounds.” #### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer “For E6 and above candidates, if you fail one system design round but do well in the other rounds, you can get a mulligan. They can let you retake one system design round. But the same isn’t true for behavioral: if you fail there’s no mulligan. If you fail the behavioral round, it will be ‘No Hire.’” #### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer 'Team matching, offers, and “Bootcamp”' --------------------------------------- Meta made some changes to their process in 2023. Before, unlike at other FAANGs, you'd generally accept an offer before knowing with which team you'd end up on. Then you'd do a 6 week “Bootcamp”, where you'd be trained on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems. After the bootcamp, there would be a 2 week team-matching period. Now, after you finish the onsite, you jump straight to the team matching process. Team matching now happens BEFORE you get an offer, and offers are contingent on team matching completely successfully. You'll talk with hiring managers from a number of teams to gauge fit and chemistry: we've heard that sometimes it's a handful, and sometimes it's over 10. After your team matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in. Once you make your choice, your recruiter will officially make an offer, and you'll usually have just a few days to make your decision. We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company.",

We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company. One other key difference between Meta's new process and the old one is what happens during Bootcamp. Historically, Bootcamp took 6 weeks, and in addition to training new hires on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems, there'd be a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching component. Bootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter - 2-4 weeks, and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers will continue to ramp up on their specific teams. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. You meet with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in. “When the market is good, you can talk to 20 different teams at the same time.” #### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer There are exceptions – some people with niche skills may get hired for a specific team before they start Bootcamp, but they still have to do the bootcamp period, just not the team-matching part afterwards.

And they want to take over the market (or the earth, depending on who you ask)...\n\nAmazon’s process is not centralized, and you can interview with multiple teams concurrently. To up your odds, interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\nAmazon really loves their [Leadership Principles (LPs)](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles)\n. Amazon interviewers may sandwich LP questions anywhere and everywhere throughout your interview rounds: coding rounds, system design rounds, all rounds. In short, at an Amazon interview, be prepared for Leadership Principles questions anywhere, anytime.\n\nFinally, Amazon has one of the more-structured interviewing cultures. They’re the only FAANG where interviewers exist in a formal hierarchy, and Amazon openly encourages and rewards interviewers who reach the top rung in that hierarchy.\n\nIn this guide we’ve compiled a comprehensive Amazon job interview prep guide based on in-depth discussions with Amazon interviewers and interviewees. Our guide includes a detailed walkthrough of the interview process, common questions and solutions, interview tips, video replays of mock Amazon interviews, and more.\n\nWant to know if you’re ready to interview at Amazon?

That said, we’ve gotten some conflicting reports from Amazonians, and it may be that Amazon has more recently started using online assessments to test the competencies of more senior engineers as well.\n\nIf you do the online assessment, here’s how it works. It’s a timed, asynchronous test consisting of several coding problems, conducted via [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)\n. These are usually data structures and algorithm problems of easy to medium-level difficulty, as well as some multiple choice system design questions where you have to select the design option that’s ideal in a given situation. If you do well in the online assessment, you can skip the second step, which is the technical phone screen.\n\nIf you end up skipping the online assessment, the first step in your process will be a recruiter call. Please see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls.”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nAmazon’s technical phone interview is a coding interview that tends to focus exclusively on data structures and algorithms. Despite the focus on speed, [Amazon interview questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n may require a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nFor these screens, Amazon uses an internal tool called Livecode, which has syntax highlighting for popular languages but does NOT have the ability to run the code. In fact, no code is ever compiled or run in Amazon technical interviews.\n\nFinally, there’s a 50% chance that your interviewer will throw in 1 or 2 Leadership Principles questions into the phone screen. They’re not guaranteed, but they’ll definitely come up during the onsite.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThere’s some variance, but the typical Amazon onsite, or in-person interview, for technical roles, will consist of:\n\n*   At least one behavioral round (this doesn’t include all the Leadership Principles questions peppered through the other interviews)\n*   Three coding rounds\n*   One system design round\n*   One hiring manager round\n\nAmazon has a special type of interviewer that they include in onsite loops: the Bar Raiser. These are typically senior-level Amazon employees at the top of the formal interviewer hierarchy, and they’re the toughest and most-trained interviewers at Amazon. They serve as an independent and objective evaluator, asking follow-up questions, and ensuring that hiring decisions are not influenced solely by the candidate's immediate team or department.\n\n![Amazon’s interview process: online assessment or recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Famazon-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n“Being a Bar Raiser makes an impact on your promotion packet. Every L5 nearing promotion at Amazon, is encouraged to do the Bar Raiser training. It’s a big input to get to L6 or L7. Part of the promotion packet is: how are you demonstrating some of the Leadership Principles. And “Hire and Develop the Best” is one of the LPs. There’s a lot of work to do in hiring to become a Bar Raiser: you have to do a lot of training and a ton of interviews. Being a Bar Raiser carries a lot of weight at Amazon if you want to get promoted.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\nAt Amazon, Bar Raisers and hiring managers are the only interviewers who have the formal authority to veto a hiring decision. You can recognize them because they are the only interviewer in your onsite loop who has nothing to do with the team you’re interviewing for. Bar Raiser rounds can be super intense, but don’t shrink when you feel a Bar Raiser throw flames your way; embrace the fire.\n\nThe three types of Amazon interview\n-----------------------------------\n\nThere are three main types of interviews you’ll face as a software engineer interviewing at Amazon. These are coding, behavioral, and system design interviews.\n\n### 1\\. Coding interview\n\nYou will have to do coding interviews in the phone screen and in the onsite. Coding rounds at the onsite are very similar to technical phone screen rounds, except that in the technical phone screen you _might_ get Leadership Principles questions, whereas in the onsite coding portion, you definitely _will_.\n\nAmazon asks mostly medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions and avoids hard questions. The idea is to let candidates demonstrate how quickly they get to the optimal result, all in the service of hiring engineers who can churn out new features quickly.\n\nDespite the focus on speed, Amazon questions may be a complex problem that requires a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nAmazon’s coding rounds test the following technical skills:\n\n1.  Computer science fundamentals and knowledge of data structures and algorithms\n2.  The ability to write logical and maintainable code. These rounds require writing some classes and implementing some functions, e.g., “Implement some common functions of a file system”\n\nAlthough your performance in technical interviews matters (if you fail the technical, you usually will not move forward), it’s not as important as the outcome of the behavioral interview, and coding interviews during the onsite at Amazon actually feature Leadership Principles questions.\n\n“Because no code is ever run on an editor, the approach, speed, and testing are most important. Code syntax, typos, variable naming, and edge cases are less important.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Amazon Interviewer\n\nGraph questions are among the most popular types of questions asked at Amazon, as well as tree questions that require BFS or DFS. Classic questions like LRU cache, meeting rooms, word break, word search, word ladder, and so on may also come up.\n\nWe’ve heard from Amazon interviewers that _all_ of the data structures and algorithms questions in Amazon’s official question bank are actually on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-amazon-questions/)\n. That said, Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in coding rounds, and some will deviate from the question bank to ask more practical questions such as, “Implement a function with some behavior with the help of these two APIs…””\n\nFinally, like Facebook, Amazon shies away from dynamic programming questions (though they’re not banned outright).\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Amazon’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Amazon coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n\" below.\n\n### 2\\. Behavioral interview\n\nThe behavioral interview is one of, along with coding interviews at the onsite, the most important in terms of leading to an offer.\n\n“I’ve done over a hundred interviews at Amazon. The behavioral interview is most likely to get someone pushed over the line if they were borderline in their technical interviews. The opposite is not true: if they don’t meet the behavioral bar, we don’t care how they did in technicals, we aren’t hiring them.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\nBehavioral is an extremely important part of the Amazon interview process – Amazon is more likely to downlevel or reject you solely based on behavioral – and their behavioral round might be the most well-thought-out interview in all of big tech. It also might be the easiest to fail if you don’t specifically prepare for it. There’s no flavor like the flavor of an Amazonian behavioral interviewer; if you’ve never encountered it before and don’t expect it, it can be jarring.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes our users make is not taking this interview seriously because at most other companies, behavioral interviews tend to be more lip service than a meaningful part of the process. The bottom line is, if you want an Amazon job at a senior level or above, you have to seriously prepare for the behavioral interview questions.\n\nNot all Leadership Principles are created equal. Customer Obsession is the 👑one Leadership Principle to rule them all. When in doubt, demonstrate Customer Obsession. If you get a curveball, give an answer that shows you’re deeply committed to making things customers love.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“If you have a bad LP round, or if LPs are problematic in the debrief, it’s almost always a ‘no hire.’ But if you have great LPs then there is a conversation where we try to see if the candidate can be hired even if the technical rounds weren't at the bar. But not the other way around. But if there’s anything ‘at the bar’ or ‘below the bar’ for LP, then you fail.”\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n“If a candidate does not do that well on the technical round but they do well on LPs, there is always a possibility of recycling the candidate because they’re a good fit for Amazon but not good for the team. So sometimes we’ll help them interview with other teams, and they don’t have to do a full onsite: they just need to do 1-2 more rounds as a follow up. But if they’re below the bar for LPs, then they’re not a fit for Amazon so Amazon wouldn’t help set them up to other teams with shortened onsites.”\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\nIn this round, expect questions from all 5 of these categories:\n\n1.  Technical problem solving\n2.  Learning (and failure)\n3.  Getting stuff (for the business) done\n4.  Interpersonal conflict\n5.  Ambiguity\n\nHonestly, the best place to find a detailed question list for Amazon’s behavioral interview, as well as a bunch of other interview preparation resources, is our [Senior Engineer's Guide to the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles)\n.\n\n### 3\\. System design interview\n\nSystem design and coding aren’t the be-all and end-all at Amazon – of course, you still have to pass them, but if your performance is borderline, doing well on behavioral Leadership Principles questions will take you over the finish line. In fact, interviewers will likely ask you 1-2 Leadership Principles questions in your system design interviews. Try to be efficient when answering LP questions in system design rounds. LPs come first. Finish them early so that you have more time for the technical question.\n\n“In many debriefs, I hear the hiring manager say that we can extend the L5 offer with the understanding that system design is not their strength, but it's coachable. At the L6 level, the system design bar is comparable to Facebook or Google.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Amazon Interviewer\n\nIf you’re in a system design round at Amazon, and you don’t know what to talk about, talk about performance. They want Amazon to be the number one customer of AWS. And they love to find engineers who understand and are passionate about fine tuning performance in the cloud.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAmazon is more likely to ask you practical system design questions. For example, if you’re interviewing with a team who controls Amazon’s inventory management, they might ask you to design a piece of an inventory management system.\n\nOther common system design questions include:\n\n*   Design autocomplete\n*   Design file upload/download to the cloud\n*   Design search\n\nThe design questions are most likely about designing well-known features, as opposed to a complete system from scratch like Design Facebook or Twitter.\n\nAmazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in system design, but a lot of interviewers fall back on reusing questions from Amazon’s question bank.\n\nFor tooling in system design interviews, candidates can usually choose any type of drawing tool. [Excalidraw](https://app.excalidraw.com/)\n is most popular, followed by [Miro](https://miro.com/)\n.\n\nHow Amazon makes hiring decisions\n---------------------------------\n\nAmazon has one of the more well-structured decision-making processes in tech: teams typically do a pre-brief (live meeting before the onsite), submit asynchronous feedback, and also do a debrief (live meeting after the onsite). They rely heavily on live discussion to make decisions. Notably, though some interviewers might be able to tell an outlier story of a time a regular interviewer out-argued a Bar Raiser, most of the time the interviewers go along with what the Bar Raiser says.\n\nAmazon interviewer’s grade on a 5-point scale: Strongly Inclined, Inclined, Neutral, Not Inclined, Strongly Not Inclined.\n\nThe two most important interviewers at the onsite are the Bar Raiser and the hiring manager. At Amazon, all of the other team members involved in the interview could vote to hire, but if the Bar Raiser _or_ the hiring manager aren’t on board, that candidate is likely getting rejected.\n\nAt Amazon, identify the Bar Raiser (the only person whose work has nothing to do with the team for which you’re interviewing) and the hiring manager (if you don’t know who it is, ask the recruiter before the onsite or an interviewer if during the onsite). Most of your energy should go towards impressing these two people – since Amazon relies so heavily on live discussions to make hiring decisions, impression management is more impactful here.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nResources to prepare yourself for an Amazon coding interview\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Amazon content for you!

That said, we’ve gotten some conflicting reports from Amazonians, and it may be that Amazon has more recently started using online assessments to test the competencies of more senior engineers as well.\n\nIf you do the online assessment, here’s how it works. It’s a timed, asynchronous test consisting of several coding problems, conducted via [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)\n. These are usually data structures and algorithm problems of easy to medium-level difficulty, as well as some multiple choice system design questions where you have to select the design option that’s ideal in a given situation. If you do well in the online assessment, you can skip the second step, which is the technical phone screen.\n\nIf you end up skipping the online assessment, the first step in your process will be a recruiter call.

In fact, no code is ever compiled or run in Amazon technical interviews.\n\nFinally, there’s a 50% chance that your interviewer will throw in 1 or 2 Leadership Principles questions into the phone screen.

          "content": "### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThere’s some variance, but the typical Amazon onsite, or in-person interview, for technical roles, will consist of:\n\n*   At least one behavioral round (this doesn’t include all the Leadership Principles questions peppered through the other interviews)\n*   Three coding rounds\n*   One system design round\n*   One hiring manager round\n\nAmazon has a special type of interviewer that they include in onsite loops: the Bar Raiser. These are typically senior-level Amazon employees at the top of the formal interviewer hierarchy, and they’re the toughest and most-trained interviewers at Amazon. They serve as an independent and objective evaluator, asking follow-up questions, and ensuring that hiring decisions are not influenced solely by the candidate's immediate team or department.\n\n![Amazon’s interview process: online assessment or recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Famazon-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n“Being a Bar Raiser makes an impact on your promotion packet. Every L5 nearing promotion at Amazon, is encouraged to do the Bar Raiser training. It’s a big input to get to L6 or L7. Part of the promotion packet is: how are you demonstrating some of the Leadership Principles. And “Hire and Develop the Best” is one of the LPs. There’s a lot of work to do in hiring to become a Bar Raiser: you have to do a lot of training and a ton of interviews. Being a Bar Raiser carries a lot of weight at Amazon if you want to get promoted.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\nAt Amazon, Bar Raisers and hiring managers are the only interviewers who have the formal authority to veto a hiring decision. You can recognize them because they are the only interviewer in your onsite loop who has nothing to do with the team you’re interviewing for. Bar Raiser rounds can be super intense, but don’t shrink when you feel a Bar Raiser throw flames your way; embrace the fire.\n\nThe three types of Amazon interview\n-----------------------------------\n\nThere are three main types of interviews you’ll face as a software engineer interviewing at Amazon. These are coding, behavioral, and system design interviews.",

          "content": "### 1\\. Coding interview\n\nYou will have to do coding interviews in the phone screen and in the onsite. Coding rounds at the onsite are very similar to technical phone screen rounds, except that in the technical phone screen you _might_ get Leadership Principles questions, whereas in the onsite coding portion, you definitely _will_.\n\nAmazon asks mostly medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions and avoids hard questions. The idea is to let candidates demonstrate how quickly they get to the optimal result, all in the service of hiring engineers who can churn out new features quickly.\n\nDespite the focus on speed, Amazon questions may be a complex problem that requires a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nAmazon’s coding rounds test the following technical skills:\n\n1.  Computer science fundamentals and knowledge of data structures and algorithms\n2.  The ability to write logical and maintainable code. These rounds require writing some classes and implementing some functions, e.g., “Implement some common functions of a file system”\n\nAlthough your performance in technical interviews matters (if you fail the technical, you usually will not move forward), it’s not as important as the outcome of the behavioral interview, and coding interviews during the onsite at Amazon actually feature Leadership Principles questions.\n\n“Because no code is ever run on an editor, the approach, speed, and testing are most important. Code syntax, typos, variable naming, and edge cases are less important.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Amazon Interviewer\n\nGraph questions are among the most popular types of questions asked at Amazon, as well as tree questions that require BFS or DFS. Classic questions like LRU cache, meeting rooms, word break, word search, word ladder, and so on may also come up.\n\nWe’ve heard from Amazon interviewers that _all_ of the data structures and algorithms questions in Amazon’s official question bank are actually on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-amazon-questions/)\n. That said, Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in coding rounds, and some will deviate from the question bank to ask more practical questions such as, “Implement a function with some behavior with the help of these two APIs…””\n\nFinally, like Facebook, Amazon shies away from dynamic programming questions (though they’re not banned outright).\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Amazon’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Amazon coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n\" below.",

          "content": "### 2\\. Behavioral interview\n\nThe behavioral interview is one of, along with coding interviews at the onsite, the most important in terms of leading to an offer.\n\n“I’ve done over a hundred interviews at Amazon. The behavioral interview is most likely to get someone pushed over the line if they were borderline in their technical interviews. The opposite is not true: if they don’t meet the behavioral bar, we don’t care how they did in technicals, we aren’t hiring them.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\nBehavioral is an extremely important part of the Amazon interview process – Amazon is more likely to downlevel or reject you solely based on behavioral – and their behavioral round might be the most well-thought-out interview in all of big tech. It also might be the easiest to fail if you don’t specifically prepare for it. There’s no flavor like the flavor of an Amazonian behavioral interviewer; if you’ve never encountered it before and don’t expect it, it can be jarring.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes our users make is not taking this interview seriously because at most other companies, behavioral interviews tend to be more lip service than a meaningful part of the process. The bottom line is, if you want an Amazon job at a senior level or above, you have to seriously prepare for the behavioral interview questions.\n\nNot all Leadership Principles are created equal. Customer Obsession is the 👑one Leadership Principle to rule them all. When in doubt, demonstrate Customer Obsession. If you get a curveball, give an answer that shows you’re deeply committed to making things customers love.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“If you have a bad LP round, or if LPs are problematic in the debrief, it’s almost always a ‘no hire.’ But if you have great LPs then there is a conversation where we try to see if the candidate can be hired even if the technical rounds weren't at the bar. But not the other way around. But if there’s anything ‘at the bar’ or ‘below the bar’ for LP, then you fail.”\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n“If a candidate does not do that well on the technical round but they do well on LPs, there is always a possibility of recycling the candidate because they’re a good fit for Amazon but not good for the team. So sometimes we’ll help them interview with other teams, and they don’t have to do a full onsite: they just need to do 1-2 more rounds as a follow up. But if they’re below the bar for LPs, then they’re not a fit for Amazon so Amazon wouldn’t help set them up to other teams with shortened onsites.”\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\nIn this round, expect questions from all 5 of these categories:\n\n1.  Technical problem solving\n2.  Learning (and failure)\n3.  Getting stuff (for the business) done\n4.  Interpersonal conflict\n5.  Ambiguity\n\nHonestly, the best place to find a detailed question list for Amazon’s behavioral interview, as well as a bunch of other interview preparation resources, is our [Senior Engineer's Guide to the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles)\n.",

System design interview\n\nSystem design and coding aren’t the be-all and end-all at Amazon – of course, you still have to pass them, but if your performance is borderline, doing well on behavioral Leadership Principles questions will take you over the finish line. In fact, interviewers will likely ask you 1-2 Leadership Principles questions in your system design interviews. Try to be efficient when answering LP questions in system design rounds. LPs come first. Finish them early so that you have more time for the technical question.\n\n“In many debriefs, I hear the hiring manager say that we can extend the L5 offer with the understanding that system design is not their strength, but it's coachable. At the L6 level, the system design bar is comparable to Facebook or Google.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Amazon Interviewer\n\nIf you’re in a system design round at Amazon, and you don’t know what to talk about, talk about performance. They want Amazon to be the number one customer of AWS. And they love to find engineers who understand and are passionate about fine tuning performance in the cloud.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAmazon is more likely to ask you practical system design questions. For example, if you’re interviewing with a team who controls Amazon’s inventory management, they might ask you to design a piece of an inventory management system.\n\nOther common system design questions include:\n\n*   Design autocomplete\n*   Design file upload/download to the cloud\n*   Design search\n\nThe design questions are most likely about designing well-known features, as opposed to a complete system from scratch like Design Facebook or Twitter.\n\nAmazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in system design, but a lot of interviewers fall back on reusing questions from Amazon’s question bank.\n\nFor tooling in system design interviews, candidates can usually choose any type of drawing tool. [Excalidraw](https://app.excalidraw.com/)\n is most popular, followed by [Miro](https://miro.com/)\n.\n\nHow Amazon makes hiring decisions\n---------------------------------\n\nAmazon has one of the more well-structured decision-making processes in tech: teams typically do a pre-brief (live meeting before the onsite), submit asynchronous feedback, and also do a debrief (live meeting after the onsite). They rely heavily on live discussion to make decisions. Notably, though some interviewers might be able to tell an outlier story of a time a regular interviewer out-argued a Bar Raiser, most of the time the interviewers go along with what the Bar Raiser says.\n\nAmazon interviewer’s grade on a 5-point scale: Strongly Inclined, Inclined, Neutral, Not Inclined, Strongly Not Inclined.\n\nThe two most important interviewers at the onsite are the Bar Raiser and the hiring manager. At Amazon, all of the other team members involved in the interview could vote to hire, but if the Bar Raiser _or_ the hiring manager aren’t on board, that candidate is likely getting rejected.\n\nAt Amazon, identify the Bar Raiser (the only person whose work has nothing to do with the team for which you’re interviewing) and the hiring manager (if you don’t know who it is, ask the recruiter before the onsite or an interviewer if during the onsite). Most of your energy should go towards impressing these two people – since Amazon relies so heavily on live discussions to make hiring decisions, impression management is more impactful here.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nResources to prepare yourself for an Amazon coding interview\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Amazon content for you!

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Microsoft interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.\n\n[See available times](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee)\n\n![](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Microsoft’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMicrosoft lets you interview with different teams at the same time; if you want to maximize your chances interview with several of them simultaneously.\n\nMicrosoft’s process is mainly (though not fully!) team-dependent. That means that while you interview for a specific team, you may not necessarily be interviewing _just_ with people on that team. For example, sometimes you might interview with the hiring manager for a specific team, and your other interviewers will be individual contributors from other teams.\n\nEach team runs their own processes, which can vary quite a bit from team to team as well. Sometimes Microsoft bakes a quasi-team-matching activity into an interview process: where a candidate can meet multiple hiring managers in the same loop. Another variation is some candidates’ first round screens are with a hiring manager instead of a recruiter.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical interview (phone screen or a Codility quiz)\n\nMicrosoft’s technical phone screen is a traditional LeetCode-style coding interview, with technical questions ranging from easy to medium. Interviewers aren’t given a rubric. Some of them get training, others don’t. They have freedom to ask whatever they want and judge your technical skills however they want in this round.\n\nIf you end up getting the asynchronous [Codility](https://www.codility.com/)\n quiz instead, you sign on and have to answer several algorithmic questions in a short amount of time. In some ways, this is harder than the technical phone screen with the human because if you don’t pass the test cases, you get filtered out. You’re judged on several factors including: test cases, correctness, and code quality.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite format can vary per org, but it typically includes the following round of interviews:\n\n*   One behavioral round of behavioral interview questions\n*   Two or three coding rounds\n*   One system design round\n*   One domain-specific round\n\nMicrosoft’s interview types in detail\n-------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThis is the most important round at Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft usually asks LeetCode-style medium-difficulty questions in coding rounds. Interviewers get to pick their own coding questions, but, according to interviewers, Microsoft favors the following topics (in no particular order):\n\n*   Arrays and strings\n*   Linked lists\n*   Graphs and trees\n\n[LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/)\n is also a helpful resource.\n\nDynamic programming used to basically never happen, but now it’s a little more common. When you do get dynamic programming problems, it’s usually the classic ones like coin change, stair steps, edit distance, and various types of counting problems.\n\nTooling for coding interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many teams use Codility.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Microsoft’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Microsoft coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft#microsoft-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nSystem design is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft, and it’s sometimes conducted by a hiring manager. One idiosyncratic aspect of Microsoft’s process is their penchant for asking questions about compliance-related topics.\n\nOutside of compliance-related questions, here are examples of other system design questions you might encounter:\n\n*   Let's go back in time, how would you ship cargo to customers? Discuss an approach that touches on availability, latency, reliability, communication, etc.\n*   Let's say we are interested in palindromes and we want to store them durably whenever we come up with them. Design a system that lets you enter a new palindrome every time someone comes up with one, and allows users to check if a palindrome exists in a system.\n*   Assume you are a teacher and you want to test students if they know the country names correctly. You are provided a list of countries and pictures. Design a webpage + backend API that mimics a test for students to evaluate their knowledge (this would be for a full-stack role).\n\nTooling for system design interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many Microsoft employees use Codility Canvas or Excalidraw.\n\n### Domain-specific round\n\nThe domain-specific round is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft. Microsoft is more likely to do these types of rounds than other FAANGs, and these rounds can feel similar to system design but involve some coding.\n\nUsually, domain-specific rounds are customized to the domain a given team works on and dives deep into that technology. So, whatever area this team is in (cloud networking, big data, etc.), that’s what they’ll ask you about.\n\nOn some occasions, Microsoft customizes a round to the candidate’s skills. For example, if you’re a backend engineer, they might ask you to design an API or design a database. They also may ask you open ended trivia questions about the programming language you are most familiar with.\n\nFinally, you may get a scenario question that’s commensurate with your skill set. For instance, if you’re a back-end engineer, you may get a question like, “Imagine you're in a team and we're building a credit card registration system. And it's used by different firms. How do you build the interface?”\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis is the least important round at Microsoft: the lowest effort way to pass is to not blame your teammates, not show red flags, and stay positive.\n\nMicrosoft doesn’t have a specific set of traits they’re looking for. You can expect the usual questions about your strengths and weaknesses, failure, conflicts with colleagues, projects, and lessons you’ve learned from past experiences in your career.\n\nUltimately, they are screening for three soft skills: positivity, ownership, and communication. They want to hire friendly people who can do the work and not blame others. This is not Apple or Netflix, where they want a particular flavor of personality, or where they ask interviewers to hire candidates they’d like to befriend. It’s more neutral.\n\nBehavioral rounds can sometimes have a coding component as well. When this happens, it might be an easy/medium-difficulty 20-min LeetCode-style problem.\n\n“Since most engineers at Microsoft use C#, if you can, you should use C#, Java, or Python in the technical rounds. This way, your interviewer will be able to understand your code better and may even be able to help.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Tree questions are most popular, e.g., various types of tree sum, tree traversals of certain orders, subtrees, etc.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“My Microsoft interview was insanely easy. I tried to step it up when I started being an interviewer at Microsoft. But then I realized that's how it has to be. Technical is like 25% of it. It’s not a generic FAANG interview. It’s more about three things: a) ‘How well does this candidate know this system they’re going to be working on?’, b) ‘How do they meet the exact needs we have on this team?’, and c) ‘Do they understand the little things we value? Like compliance, manipulating data, data pipelines, EU data processing, etc.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Microsoft is obsessed with the details of compliance. I don’t think I have seen a system that is as set up for auditing as Microsoft. Employees are asked to log so much. There’s a centralized grid system which is built into Azure. All logs are to be routed into that. This allows for centralized log spanning and auditing. Which I have not seen anywhere else.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Another thing that happens in these rounds is they’ll ask you to discuss a complicated problem you have solved at your job. It's good for candidates to prepare to discuss 2-3 projects in detail: how did they implement caching, deal with scaling issues, and so on.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“A lot of people struggle with ‘What are your top 2 strengths and weaknesses?’ probably because they are trying to make up an answer on the spot. Good to prep answers to typical behavioral questions in advance.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\nHow Microsoft makes hiring decisions\n------------------------------------\n\nInterviewers grade candidates on different scales, depending on the team.\n\nSome orgs have an asynchronous feedback process, other orgs rely on live discussion, and still-other orgs do both. Some orgs have rubrics, and others don’t. Here’s how a rubric looks at one org:\n\n*   Junior: Has growth mindset, seeks to understand ideas\n*   Senior: Drives self development, models openness, failure is okay, open to different ideas\n*   Principal: Consistently challenges group thinking towards productive discussion\n\nMicrosoft coding interview preparation resources\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are a few more interview tips and resources to help you prep for a software developer or software engineer interview at Microsoft.\n\n*   Microsoft interviewers can ask whatever questions they want, yet some interviewers repeat questions, so [LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/)\n     is somewhat helpful.\n*   Study up on the services the team you’re interviewing with uses.\n*   Ask your recruiter for specifics about your rounds. If you get nothing helpful, then practice practical questions, LeetCode-style questions, and domain-specific questions.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Microsoft content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Microsoft interviewers, long-form solutions to common Microsoft questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Microsoft interviews.\n\n### Microsoft interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Microsoft interviewers on our platform.

They have freedom to ask whatever they want and judge your technical skills however they want in this round.\n\nIf you end up getting the asynchronous [Codility](https://www.codility.com/)\n quiz instead, you sign on and have to answer several algorithmic questions in a short amount of time.

Discuss an approach that touches on availability, latency, reliability, communication, etc.\n*   Let's say we are interested in palindromes and we want to store them durably whenever we come up with them. Design a system that lets you enter a new palindrome every time someone comes up with one, and allows users to check if a palindrome exists in a system.\n*   Assume you are a teacher and you want to test students if they know the country names correctly. You are provided a list of countries and pictures.

Microsoft is more likely to do these types of rounds than other FAANGs, and these rounds can feel similar to system design but involve some coding.\n\nUsually, domain-specific rounds are customized to the domain a given team works on and dives deep into that technology. So, whatever area this team is in (cloud networking, big data, etc.), that’s what they’ll ask you about.\n\nOn some occasions, Microsoft customizes a round to the candidate’s skills. For example, if you’re a backend engineer, they might ask you to design an API or design a database. They also may ask you open ended trivia questions about the programming language you are most familiar with.\n\nFinally, you may get a scenario question that’s commensurate with your skill set. For instance, if you’re a back-end engineer, you may get a question like, “Imagine you're in a team and we're building a credit card registration system. And it's used by different firms. How do you build the interface?”",

          "content": "### Behavioral\n\nThis is the least important round at Microsoft: the lowest effort way to pass is to not blame your teammates, not show red flags, and stay positive.\n\nMicrosoft doesn’t have a specific set of traits they’re looking for. You can expect the usual questions about your strengths and weaknesses, failure, conflicts with colleagues, projects, and lessons you’ve learned from past experiences in your career.\n\nUltimately, they are screening for three soft skills: positivity, ownership, and communication. They want to hire friendly people who can do the work and not blame others. This is not Apple or Netflix, where they want a particular flavor of personality, or where they ask interviewers to hire candidates they’d like to befriend. It’s more neutral.\n\nBehavioral rounds can sometimes have a coding component as well. When this happens, it might be an easy/medium-difficulty 20-min LeetCode-style problem.\n\n“Since most engineers at Microsoft use C#, if you can, you should use C#, Java, or Python in the technical rounds. This way, your interviewer will be able to understand your code better and may even be able to help.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Tree questions are most popular, e.g., various types of tree sum, tree traversals of certain orders, subtrees, etc.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“My Microsoft interview was insanely easy. I tried to step it up when I started being an interviewer at Microsoft. But then I realized that's how it has to be. Technical is like 25% of it. It’s not a generic FAANG interview. It’s more about three things: a) ‘How well does this candidate know this system they’re going to be working on?’, b) ‘How do they meet the exact needs we have on this team?’, and c) ‘Do they understand the little things we value? Like compliance, manipulating data, data pipelines, EU data processing, etc.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Microsoft is obsessed with the details of compliance. I don’t think I have seen a system that is as set up for auditing as Microsoft. Employees are asked to log so much. There’s a centralized grid system which is built into Azure. All logs are to be routed into that. This allows for centralized log spanning and auditing. Which I have not seen anywhere else.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Another thing that happens in these rounds is they’ll ask you to discuss a complicated problem you have solved at your job. It's good for candidates to prepare to discuss 2-3 projects in detail: how did they implement caching, deal with scaling issues, and so on.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“A lot of people struggle with ‘What are your top 2 strengths and weaknesses?’ probably because they are trying to make up an answer on the spot. Good to prep answers to typical behavioral questions in advance.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\nHow Microsoft makes hiring decisions\n------------------------------------\n\nInterviewers grade candidates on different scales, depending on the team.\n\nSome orgs have an asynchronous feedback process, other orgs rely on live discussion, and still-other orgs do both. Some orgs have rubrics, and others don’t. Here’s how a rubric looks at one org:\n\n*   Junior: Has growth mindset, seeks to understand ideas\n*   Senior: Drives self development, models openness, failure is okay, open to different ideas\n*   Principal: Consistently challenges group thinking towards productive discussion\n\nMicrosoft coding interview preparation resources\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are a few more interview tips and resources to help you prep for a software developer or software engineer interview at Microsoft.\n\n*   Microsoft interviewers can ask whatever questions they want, yet some interviewers repeat questions, so [LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/)\n     is somewhat helpful.\n*   Study up on the services the team you’re interviewing with uses.\n*   Ask your recruiter for specifics about your rounds. If you get nothing helpful, then practice practical questions, LeetCode-style questions, and domain-specific questions.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Microsoft content for you!

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Netflix interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.\n\n[See available times](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee)\n\n![](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Netflix’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nEvery human organization views themselves as a metaphor; Netflix doesn’t view themselves as a family like some other tech companies, they view themselves as a high-caliber sports team (in fact, Netflix calls their employees a “dream team”). They explain this metaphor themselves in their infamous culture memo.\n\nFinally, Netflix’s interview process is decentralized and team-dependent. Moreover, you can interview with multiple teams at Netflix concurrently, which can help you increase your odds of securing a job offer.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Hiring manager screen\n\nThis is a 30 minute call. A former Netflix employee called this round “Very chill, especially compared to the onsite.” This round consists of bidirectional surface-level questions.\n\nThe hiring manager will also be selling you on Netflix. Hiring managers doing selling is business as usual, but in this case, it serves an additional purpose – because their onsite is by far the most intense, they have to sell harder upfront because the onsite is a bigger commitment for the candidates.\n\n### Step 3: Technical phone screen\n\nThe Netflix technical phone screen is a coding interview that typically lasts 45-60 minutes. There is significant inter-team variation on what these interviews cover, and the tooling you use during these interviews also varies by team,\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nOnsite interview structure varies from team to team, but you’ll have roughly 8 interviews focused primarily on system design, then behavioral, and then coding.\n\nDepending on the length of the onsite, Netflix recruiting may ask you if you’d prefer to split the onsite over two days, and we recommend that you proactively ask to do that, given how taxing the behavioral and system design portions are!\n\nNetflix is the only FAANG that routinely includes 1-2 directors in their onsite loops. If your loop has two, it’ll be one director will be from your org and another from a partner org. Netflix does this to reduce bias. One director may do a system design interview, and the other will do a behavioral interview.\n\n“Don’t be thrown off by having to talk to directors. Just stick to the principles: when you speak about technical stuff you’ve worked on, focus on scale, availability, and security. When you speak about behavioral stuff: use shared ideas from their culture deck, take accountability for your wins and failures, and demonstrate metrics and impact.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“The HRBP \\[which is basically a very senior recruiting function\\] and the director would typically focus on behavioral rounds. I have also seen directors spending time (30 mins) just letting candidates ask and clarify any questions that they might have regarding the team, Netflix culture, career growth path or any other aspects. So, a strong recommendation would be to be ready with your genuine questions list and get things clarified in such interviews. Candid conversation is one of the key values at Netflix and asking genuine concerns if any is seen through good lenses, as that establishes candidates' seriousness about the role to some extent.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\nNetflix’s interview types in detail\n-----------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThe technical questions Netflix asks vary from team to team. Some teams don’t ask LeetCode questions. Other teams will ask medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions with a creative/practical twist.\n\nThese rounds are going to change team by team, but the pattern we’ve noticed is that Netflix coding questions often come in two parts.\n\nTypically there is one question and, in scenarios where edge cases and tests are done early, say within 45 minutes, the interviewer may choose to spend some time discussing general large scale engineering concepts and distributed systems (like microservices, scalability, etc.). For instance, some expansions could be:\n\n*   A system design expansion on top of the coding question, such as a practical application where they ask you to apply the solution you just found to a part of their real-life system\n*   A deep dive into a specific skill set (e.g., if this team codes in Java: they’ll have a round all about multithreading for Java specifically)\n*   For everything you need to prepare for Netflix’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Netflix coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix#netflix-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n    \" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThis is the most important round at Netflix. Coding carries the least weight, behavioral carries a lot, and system design has the most.\n\nNetflix system design rounds are highly unique and highly challenging. Netflix is to system design as Google is to coding; these technical interview rounds include the most difficult and bespoke questions.\n\nSimilar to how Amazon loves Leadership Principles, Netflix loves system design so much they even throw it into coding rounds sometimes – first, you solve a LeetCode-style problem. Then they ask you to apply it to a real-world use case.\n\nThat said, Netflix system design rounds are easier to prepare for if you know the patterns: Netflix loves scale. Netflix never wants to go down, and Netflix hates when things aren’t secure. Availability is super important to them; they want to ask and hear about tactics to scale systems, keep systems highly available, and maintain secure systems.\n\nAt Netflix, you’re likely to see unique questions that you won’t get anywhere else, and the system design round is the part of the process that Netflix interviewers take the most pride in, so they make up hard, one-of-a-kind questions from scratch. Thematically, their questions are more likely to be focused on scaling. They also like to ask about security and availability.\n\nIn fact, Netflix is more likely than the rest of FAANG to give you a system design round focused solely on security. For instance, you might get asked what you would do during a DDoS attack, and the entirety of the session will be spent drilling down into the details. And because they’re also obsessed with availability, you might get questions around backups and what to do if a service goes down.\n\nMoreover, as with their coding rounds, Netflix prefers questions with a practical application, and they’re likely to ask you about something they’re working on right now. If you research the hell out of their architecture – specifically the service that particular team is in charge of – and the other services this service interacts with, you’ll be in good shape.\n\nYou’re also likely to see a “reverse system design” round, where your interviewer will ask you pointed questions about the systems you’ve worked on before, e.g., the largest scale system you’ve worked on, how did you manage it, how did you scale it, etc.\n\nQuestions they most likely _won’t_ ask are product-focused questions, such as “Design Spotify”.\n\nWhat tooling you use in these interviews depends on the team you’re interviewing with.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nAnswers to behavioral questions are almost as important as system design at Netflix. You’ll get rejected if you fail the behavioral screen.\n\nThese interviews have a heavy emphasis on the candidate being a cultural fit, being able to work in a team, having curiosity, and being product minded, highly motivated individuals capable of driving products forward.\n\nA unique part of Netflix’s behavioral interview is the “Dream Team” interview. This is a slightly more intense behavioral round conducted by a director. The \"volume\" is turned up on all of the things you might see in a typical behavioral round at Netflix (scale, accountability, open communication about concerns, high risk and high reward.)\n\nOne key thing you need to do before your Netflix behavioral interview is read their culture memo. Our interviewers tell us that if you don’t do this, you will fail the behavioral round.\n\nNetflix will ask about impressive things you’ve done, as well as dig into your motivation (your “why”). This round will feel like you’re doing self-promotion. Typical questions will ask about your favorite project, latest project, and most significant project, as well as open-ended questions about what you’re looking for in your next role and why you’re interested in Netflix.\n\nIt can be nerve-wracking to talk to a director for 45-60 minutes. It’s more nerve-wracking when, out the gate, they ask you to describe the biggest thing you’ve ever worked on. When talking to a director, it’s more important to have metrics and impact statements.\n\nLearn about Netflix’s overall architecture so you can a) speak their language, and b) build or speak of something similar (in the interview) that Netflix has already built but simpler.\n\nFor the team you interview with: what’s their tech stack? What open source stuff do they do? With which other services might their service interact? That last question is most critical. If you can put forethought into how their current system works, you’ll have a huge leg up; then all you’ll need to do is discuss what you learned about their system to score a bunch of points with any of their interviewers.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“Netflix doesn’t hire as much as other FAANGs, so they want to make sure you're a star.

We recommend the following resources to all engineers interviewing at FAANG:\n\n*   [A Senior Engineer's Guide to the System Design Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n    \n*   Brush up on scaling, security, availability, microservices, and failure recovery/backups\n*   Research the hell out of the technology the team you’re interviewing with makes. Then practice taking a low-level system design question, coming to a quick solution, and then applying it to a piece of the real-world system this specific team works on.\n*   Practice low-level system design questions more than high-level ones.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThese resources will help you “learn their language.” Then, when you communicate with Netflix, speak their language.\n\n*   [Khan Academy’s intro to impression management](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/individuals-and-society/social-interactions/v/impression-management)\n    \n*   [Netflix’s famous culture slide deck](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)\n    \n*   Watch a few videos on the [YouTube Channel called “WeAreNetflix”](https://www.youtube.com/@WeAreNetflix/videos)\n    \n\nWant to know if you’re ready to interview at Netflix?

If your loop has two, it’ll be one director will be from your org and another from a partner org. Netflix does this to reduce bias. One director may do a system design interview, and the other will do a behavioral interview.\n\n“Don’t be thrown off by having to talk to directors. Just stick to the principles: when you speak about technical stuff you’ve worked on, focus on scale, availability, and security. When you speak about behavioral stuff: use shared ideas from their culture deck, take accountability for your wins and failures, and demonstrate metrics and impact.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“The HRBP \\[which is basically a very senior recruiting function\\] and the director would typically focus on behavioral rounds. I have also seen directors spending time (30 mins) just letting candidates ask and clarify any questions that they might have regarding the team, Netflix culture, career growth path or any other aspects. So, a strong recommendation would be to be ready with your genuine questions list and get things clarified in such interviews. Candid conversation is one of the key values at Netflix and asking genuine concerns if any is seen through good lenses, as that establishes candidates' seriousness about the role to some extent.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\nNetflix’s interview types in detail\n-----------------------------------",

Other teams will ask medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions with a creative/practical twist.\n\nThese rounds are going to change team by team, but the pattern we’ve noticed is that Netflix coding questions often come in two parts.\n\nTypically there is one question and, in scenarios where edge cases and tests are done early, say within 45 minutes, the interviewer may choose to spend some time discussing general large scale engineering concepts and distributed systems (like microservices, scalability, etc.). For instance, some expansions could be:\n\n*   A system design expansion on top of the coding question, such as a practical application where they ask you to apply the solution you just found to a part of their real-life system\n*   A deep dive into a specific skill set (e.g., if this team codes in Java: they’ll have a round all about multithreading for Java specifically)\n*   For everything you need to prepare for Netflix’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Netflix coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix#netflix-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n    \" below.",

          "content": "### System design\n\nThis is the most important round at Netflix. Coding carries the least weight, behavioral carries a lot, and system design has the most.\n\nNetflix system design rounds are highly unique and highly challenging. Netflix is to system design as Google is to coding; these technical interview rounds include the most difficult and bespoke questions.\n\nSimilar to how Amazon loves Leadership Principles, Netflix loves system design so much they even throw it into coding rounds sometimes – first, you solve a LeetCode-style problem. Then they ask you to apply it to a real-world use case.\n\nThat said, Netflix system design rounds are easier to prepare for if you know the patterns: Netflix loves scale. Netflix never wants to go down, and Netflix hates when things aren’t secure. Availability is super important to them; they want to ask and hear about tactics to scale systems, keep systems highly available, and maintain secure systems.\n\nAt Netflix, you’re likely to see unique questions that you won’t get anywhere else, and the system design round is the part of the process that Netflix interviewers take the most pride in, so they make up hard, one-of-a-kind questions from scratch. Thematically, their questions are more likely to be focused on scaling. They also like to ask about security and availability.\n\nIn fact, Netflix is more likely than the rest of FAANG to give you a system design round focused solely on security. For instance, you might get asked what you would do during a DDoS attack, and the entirety of the session will be spent drilling down into the details. And because they’re also obsessed with availability, you might get questions around backups and what to do if a service goes down.\n\nMoreover, as with their coding rounds, Netflix prefers questions with a practical application, and they’re likely to ask you about something they’re working on right now. If you research the hell out of their architecture – specifically the service that particular team is in charge of – and the other services this service interacts with, you’ll be in good shape.\n\nYou’re also likely to see a “reverse system design” round, where your interviewer will ask you pointed questions about the systems you’ve worked on before, e.g., the largest scale system you’ve worked on, how did you manage it, how did you scale it, etc.\n\nQuestions they most likely _won’t_ ask are product-focused questions, such as “Design Spotify”.\n\nWhat tooling you use in these interviews depends on the team you’re interviewing with.",

          "content": "### Behavioral\n\nAnswers to behavioral questions are almost as important as system design at Netflix. You’ll get rejected if you fail the behavioral screen.\n\nThese interviews have a heavy emphasis on the candidate being a cultural fit, being able to work in a team, having curiosity, and being product minded, highly motivated individuals capable of driving products forward.\n\nA unique part of Netflix’s behavioral interview is the “Dream Team” interview. This is a slightly more intense behavioral round conducted by a director. The \"volume\" is turned up on all of the things you might see in a typical behavioral round at Netflix (scale, accountability, open communication about concerns, high risk and high reward.)\n\nOne key thing you need to do before your Netflix behavioral interview is read their culture memo. Our interviewers tell us that if you don’t do this, you will fail the behavioral round.\n\nNetflix will ask about impressive things you’ve done, as well as dig into your motivation (your “why”). This round will feel like you’re doing self-promotion. Typical questions will ask about your favorite project, latest project, and most significant project, as well as open-ended questions about what you’re looking for in your next role and why you’re interested in Netflix.\n\nIt can be nerve-wracking to talk to a director for 45-60 minutes. It’s more nerve-wracking when, out the gate, they ask you to describe the biggest thing you’ve ever worked on. When talking to a director, it’s more important to have metrics and impact statements.\n\nLearn about Netflix’s overall architecture so you can a) speak their language, and b) build or speak of something similar (in the interview) that Netflix has already built but simpler.\n\nFor the team you interview with: what’s their tech stack? What open source stuff do they do? With which other services might their service interact? That last question is most critical. If you can put forethought into how their current system works, you’ll have a huge leg up; then all you’ll need to do is discuss what you learned about their system to score a bunch of points with any of their interviewers.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“Netflix doesn’t hire as much as other FAANGs, so they want to make sure you're a star.

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Apple interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.\n\n[See available times](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee)\n\n![](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Apple’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interview experience.\n\nHumans in groups act out a chosen metaphor; Apple isn’t a sports team. They’re an army. Their army is made up of people obsessed with making great products. And they look to hire people who’ve embedded Apple products into their lives. Armies reward loyalty more than sports teams. Apple also has the longest tenured employees in FAANG (we're including Microsoft with FAANG for the purposes of this guide).\n\nApple is decentralized and lets candidates interview with different teams concurrently; if you want to maximize your odds interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\nApple’s interview process is more like what you might see at a startup than any other FAANG – from assigning which questions to ask to interviewer training to how hiring decisions get made. Significant inter-team variance is the norm, with each team essentially acting like a startup that’s coming up with its own way of conducting interviews.\n\nApple is the most likely to shock you; they’re more likely to ask you something you didn’t prepare for. Out of all the FAANGs, they’re the ones you can expect to do something unexpected, and some of their tactics can seem mercenary. Apple is the only FAANG which sometimes has a process to cut interviews short if the candidate clearly isn’t meeting the bar – if you don't perform above the bar for the first half of the interview, they’ll cancel the rest.\n\nApple is not results or process oriented. They’re motivation oriented. In other words, they care more about the “Why” than the “What” or the “How”, and as such, they value behavioral interviews more than coding.\n\nApple employees are obsessed with privacy. It’s not just marketing lip service. When asked if “privacy” is a buzzword at Apple, our interviewers said…\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n for what to expect. We do encourage you to ask your recruiter what to expect for the rest of the process because as you’ll see, there is a lot of variance from team to team.\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone interview\n\nLike everything else at Apple, the format and technical questions presented in Apple phone screens can vary a ton. Verify this by asking your recruiter!\n\nTechnical phone screens are coding interviews that range from 30 minutes to an hour. This tech interview may be between you and a single interviewer or sometimes a panel of interviewers. It may even be a hiring manager screen with a mix of behavioral questions and coding.\n\nIn any case, the general format is a shared coding environment where the interviewer(s) can assess your ability to utilize basic data structures and algorithms concepts. Being able to provide a solution for coding questions and quickly analyze the runtime complexity of your solution are key skills to have going into this interview.\n\nThe tooling used in Apple’s technical interview rounds depends on the team you’re interviewing with, but we’ve heard that some teams use CoderPad.\n\n### (In some cases) Step 2.5: Take-home assignment\n\nSome teams give candidates a take-home assignment. They can give this around the same time they schedule a phone screen. The hiring manager is usually the person to decide whether or not candidates get one.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThere will be roughly six to eight in-person rounds of interviews, each of which will be with your future teammates. Each round will have least one, or possibly two, interviewers.\n\nNote that an onsite loop with one team at Apple will look very different than an onsite loop with another.\n\n“I interviewed with like 12 teams. I got 2 offers. Along the way, I told one of the Apple recruiter’s I was interviewing for another Apple team and they shrugged it off; they didn’t care.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\nAt Apple, there’s no formal interviewer training. It’s very ad hoc. Every team is different. There is literally no process. What each of the teams does is rely on one of their very senior engineers or someone very experienced. Apple has a lot of people with long tenures, like 15 years. One of my colleagues had been there for 22 years. At Apple, the more senior you get the more the team trusts you to come up with your own questions. So what the interviewers at Apple typically do: you come up with a question that's not online, and you make sure it’s relevant to what your team is doing. Then you pitch it to your manager or tech lead. Then you run with it.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“One thing not enough candidates know about is this: there’s no such thing as an Apple interview. You apply for a team. Not the company. When people ask me “How to prepare for an Apple interview?” I say ask the recruiter. Because they usually know what types of questions are asked. The recruiter spends 30 minutes or an hour per debrief where engineers are talking about the details about the code. So if the recruiter is paying attention or is at least a little bit technical, they should have a clue whether it’s LeetCode-style questions or embedded style questions. So ask your Apple recruiter a forced-choice question like, ‘Is this interview more X or more Y?’”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I was one of the people to come up with a take-home assignment for candidates. Which was my favorite part of the process at Apple. We were hiring people for full-stack but not just any full-stack – we wanted people who were coding in Python on the back-end and a particular framework on the front-end. We cooked up a take-home which was a scaled down version of what they’d be doing on the job: an internal tool built in those exact technologies. We gave them that take home and had them work on it for a week. Then we discussed it at the onsite where we’d live-debug it and talk about architecture. I really liked this ‘Try before you buy’ style process. Because Apple really wants you to be productive in week 2, if not at the end of week 1.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“If by the fourth round, the hiring manager has gotten consistent feedback that doesn’t meet the bar, then they’d end the onsite early and reject the candidate.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Privacy isn't just a buzzword. We are obsessed with it. To drive that part home. Because it’s so important. And as I mentioned, I was a part of a group focused on gathering user data - users here being Apple internal employees – to inform future products.\n\nEven at Apple, when we’re just getting data from internal employees, we anonymized the data. Just to practice what we preach. Privacy is huge. Another example to illustrate that is that people get fired for torrenting music.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Unless you’re interviewing for a security role, very rarely. Technical people at Apple are hired to do what they do best. They have a whole army of compliance folks and lawyers to take care of that stuff. They also have an internal police force called “InfoSec”, which is the team which takes care of the secrecy stuff. Engineers are needed to do what they were hired to do: engineering.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Ask your Apple recruiter forced choice questions with two options, such as, ‘Is this coding round more of a typical LeetCode round, or more of a domain-specific open ended deep dive into a specific technology?’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nApple’s interview types in detail\n---------------------------------\n\nInterviewers can ask whatever behavioral, coding, or system design questions they want; there is no standardization for Apple interview questions. However, before an interview loop takes place, some teams will do a quick, informal assignment of what kinds of questions each interviewer is supposed to ask so that they don’t all end up asking the same things.\n\nMoreover, Apple interviewers are untrained, and as soon as a senior engineer is hired they can start conducting interviews.\n\nApple’s unpredictable nature makes it so some of their interview rounds can’t be categorized into behavioral, coding, or system design. Is a philosophical question about products a behavioral question? Not really. But they might ask one in a behavioral round. Are rapid fire infrastructure-focused open-ended trivia questions more system design or coding? It depends.\n\nFor example, here’s how one Apple interviewer describes the behind-the-scenes top-down directive before an upcoming onsite. “Go find a question that would be a good one to ask for our team.” That interviewer then ran it up the chain to an engineer above them. Then, that question immediately got asked in the next interview.\n\nAt Apple, each interview loop is specific to the needs of individual hiring managers – there is no canonical “Apple interview”, and everything is “made to order” for each specific team. That makes it difficult for candidates to prepare.\n\n### Coding\n\nSome teams at Apple prefer practical rounds. Sometimes, they’ll have you write a program on your own laptop and IDE. Other times, they’ll spend the whole round deep diving into a specific technology/use case that’s relevant for their team. For example, a team that wrote in Java and did a lot of work with concurrency had a whole round focused on concurrency in Java!\n\nOther teams do medium-ish LeetCode-style questions.\n\nAt the end of the day, these interviews vary so widely it’s hard to give a specific directive, other than: ask your recruiter. For senior and above candidates, it’s more about demonstrating competence rather than needing to ace the question.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Apple’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Apple coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple#apple-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nApple interviewers tend to ask questions relevant to a specific team’s work. For instance, a team focused on building web services will tend to ask questions about that, while front-end teams may ask UI-related questions. It may be good to try to get a feel for the day-to-day work from the recruiter/hiring manager, as the job descriptions are not always the most helpful (remember: privacy!).\n\n### Behavioral\n\nApple’s most important round is usually behavioral or system design. Behavioral rounds are more important than coding rounds.\n\nAn interesting paradox at Apple is: they highly value behavioral rounds but they don’t have a standardized way to assess candidates in those interviews\n\nBecause Apple doesn’t standardize their interviews, they’re particularly prone to bias. Sometimes the top down guidance to Apple interviewers is something like: “In the behavioral round, just see if you like them. See if you’d like to get a beer with them.”\n\nEven if rounds aren’t standardized, you will definitely be asked “Why Apple?”, and your answer needs to be on point. Some interviewers reject candidates solely for not having a good answer to this question. “Why Apple?” isn’t always a single question; they can spread this out into multiple questions and drill down on this for a good portion of a behavioral round. You can also expect other motivation-based (or “why”) questions.\n\nApple wants to hire candidates whose lives have integrated with the Apple products. And the reverse is true too. It's a fatal flaw to say, “I've never used an iPhone or a Macbook or an iPad” because those people clearly haven’t integrated Apple products deeply in their lives.\n\nApple knows what they like, and they like their products! That doesn’t mean all you have to do is gush about the products to pass the behavioral round. It means you have to tell a genuine story which connects you and Apple products or services. Ideally, a story they will remember.\n\nAnother behavioral factor debated among Apple interviewers is whether or not they agree with the idea that Apple is “cult-ish.”\n\nOur theory is that Apple is more likely to reward employees (and candidates) who act like the leader. [If you listen to 1:00:36 - 1:02:05 in an interview with Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3636)\n, you’ll see some stark similarities to how Apple interviewers talk about the organization. In this clip, he says, “You know how many committees we have? None. We are organized like a startup.” He then describes the benefits of silos and dividing things up.\n\nPrivacy and politics are the natural consequence of a place intentionally designed to be siloed and divided up and kept separate. It’s a cost that Apple accepts because the gain is increased productivity. Put people in closed systems (teams and orgs that don’t talk to other teams and orgs) and watch them get more done. This system works like blinders on a racehorse: it keeps vision focused down the track, on the goal, minimizing peripheral distraction. That’s all they need to see and they run/work faster because of it.\n\nOne final aspect of Apple’s behavioral rounds is that they will ask you specific questions about relevant skills. For example, if a team works with big data, they will ask specifically about a time you have worked with large-scale distributed systems in the context of your answer. If you don’t have direct experience with the field, they will try to get as close as possible, like asking you for what tradeoffs you’ve made when choosing a storage system. These behavioral interview questions serve two purposes: showing you have had relevant experience in the context of what the team is hiring for and trying to get you to talk about a particular behavioral skill (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution).\n\nIn system design rounds, Apple interviewers love to hear about reliability. If you don’t know what else to talk about, dig into reliability.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“In behavioral, you gotta be a rockstar. You gotta be a leader. If you’re abrasive, or if you’re not a cultural fit, how are you going to lead the juniors? And system design is going to weigh a little more than behavioral. If you can’t code or if you’re a little rusty –if you’re good at system design and behavioral–we’ll forgive the subpar coding rounds.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Towards the end of my career at Apple, we had a huge need for mobile developers. People who were able to do iOS apps. I was part of an R&D team. We mainly built web products in the beginning, but towards the end of my career we started doing more mobile stuff. We didn't want to hire someone who could only do mobile. We wanted someone who would be half as good at mobile stuff and half as good at web stuff, so they could plug themselves in anywhere.\n\nIf the interview process was standardized across the whole company - you can imagine how hard that would be to test specifically for the niche skill set we needed. Within two days we cooked up a whole new homework assignment just for the ios candidates, we cooked up a whole new set of interview questions. We kept the behavioral part the same. But the technical part - we flipped it over just like that. And it was really good. We changed the way we graded, we were able to filter candidates based on the new set of questions. It was just fast. We didn't get any pushback from HR. We didn't have to work with compliance. We just did it. Really fast. Really nimble.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“\\[Interviews are never standardized.\\] And i’ll tell you why. Apple is a very secretive company. Everything is on a need to know basis. Also, it's a hugely political place. It was good for me because I understood the game. I didn’t blame the players I played the game. For those who understand the intricacies of politics, and simply accept the fact that it will happen when you have all Type-A people being paid a tremendous amount of money to do shitty little things, it's bound to happen. You have to accept it or you’re not going to play the game. Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another. That's actually one of the strengths and weaknesses of Apple. We double effort for sure. But that doesn't matter to Tim Cook. They have billions of dollars to afford this – not a problem. I also really liked how it was siloed because teams and their priorities change, leadership changes, a lot of things change. Being able to decouple from the greater company enabled them to become one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech company in the world.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“A common red flag is giving generic answers to the ‘Why Apple?’ questions. If I didn't feel their passion or if they’re just treating Apple as another job, that’s usually a red flag for me regardless of their technical competence. They really have to somehow convince me – and this is an emotional response they have to bring out of me – they really have to convince me they really want to work at Apple, they really want to roll up their sleeves, and they really believe in our values: delighting the customer, sweating the details. Making awesome products… We only care about that. We don't care about anything else. That emotional response has to be drawn from me and if they don’t then I’m likely to say, ‘They were good but meh.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I can tell you about a great answer one candidate had for ‘Why Apple?”. He said something like… His wife and him were university students dating across two continents. This person said they shared a recent feature – I think it was like when you facetime and you can watch video in sync – he shared how that changed his life. His wife and him went through the whole international relationship because of that. That significantly helped their relationship.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Apple cares most about the ‘Why’. You see that rooted deeply in every apple person's DNA. ‘Why Apple?’ Right? I guess this is where people get this notion of Apple being a ‘cult-ish’ company. Much like Tesla, actually. They have a huge customer following, but you also see the same pattern with their employees. Actually, I totally subscribe to this ideology. Because you want a person you work with day in and day out to have that same passion. Sometimes you're going to have to work overtime. You're not going to get paid extra for that. Sometimes you're going to work weekends. Sometimes shit’s gonna hit the fan. You don't want to work with someone who whines about it.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\nHow Apple makes hiring decisions\n--------------------------------\n\nAs evidenced by the highest chaos score, Apple doesn’t do many things in hiring consistently, across the whole company. One trend is that Apple teams rely on post-interview live discussions to make hiring decisions. This varies from somewhat informal (compared to the rest of FAANG) to laughably informal.\n\nBecause of the informal decision-making process and reliance on live discussion, managing the impressions of your interviewers is more important at Apple than at other FAANG. In these decision-making meetings, if there’s dissent, they strive for consensus. The people on one side try to convince the other side. This process can last 15-30 minutes on average; all FAANG companies say interviewers fight for candidates, but Apple tends to fight more than most of them.\n\nBecause of their patterns of live-discussions and striving for consensus, Apple interviewers are more likely to fight for or against you (if your performance was on the fence) than any other FAANG, except _maybe_ Netflix.\n\nUltimately, the hiring manager for that particular role has the most say, which means that that’s the person you should be working to impress the most.\n\n“Post-onsite feedback for my org was 100% live discussions. At Apple I never had to write feedback. Which made me do more interviews. We made the decision on the same day. Everyone had to make a decision at the end of the day. Do an onsite, then at 5pm, we gather in a single meeting room, we do on the count of three: thumbs up, down, or in the middle. Then we talk after seeing the thumbs. And try to convince the people on the other side. If there’s less than 5 thumbs-up, then that might be an instant rejection. If there’s 6 or 7 or more thumbs up, the ‘thumbs up’ people try to convince the other side. Or in that same situation, the 3 or 4 thumbs down will try to convince the other side.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“My manager wanted to hire this person. But he failed my interview so badly. I didn't want to argue with my manager but at the same time I didn't want to work with this person. Because we are hiring people we’d work with on a daily basis. So arguments happen a lot. And in this case, I was the only ‘no’ on the board and the candidate got rejected.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\nApple coding interview preparation resources\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Apple content for you!

          "content": "### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThere will be roughly six to eight in-person rounds of interviews, each of which will be with your future teammates. Each round will have least one, or possibly two, interviewers.\n\nNote that an onsite loop with one team at Apple will look very different than an onsite loop with another.\n\n“I interviewed with like 12 teams. I got 2 offers. Along the way, I told one of the Apple recruiter’s I was interviewing for another Apple team and they shrugged it off; they didn’t care.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\nAt Apple, there’s no formal interviewer training. It’s very ad hoc. Every team is different. There is literally no process. What each of the teams does is rely on one of their very senior engineers or someone very experienced. Apple has a lot of people with long tenures, like 15 years. One of my colleagues had been there for 22 years. At Apple, the more senior you get the more the team trusts you to come up with your own questions. So what the interviewers at Apple typically do: you come up with a question that's not online, and you make sure it’s relevant to what your team is doing. Then you pitch it to your manager or tech lead. Then you run with it.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“One thing not enough candidates know about is this: there’s no such thing as an Apple interview. You apply for a team. Not the company. When people ask me “How to prepare for an Apple interview?” I say ask the recruiter. Because they usually know what types of questions are asked. The recruiter spends 30 minutes or an hour per debrief where engineers are talking about the details about the code. So if the recruiter is paying attention or is at least a little bit technical, they should have a clue whether it’s LeetCode-style questions or embedded style questions. So ask your Apple recruiter a forced-choice question like, ‘Is this interview more X or more Y?’”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I was one of the people to come up with a take-home assignment for candidates. Which was my favorite part of the process at Apple. We were hiring people for full-stack but not just any full-stack – we wanted people who were coding in Python on the back-end and a particular framework on the front-end. We cooked up a take-home which was a scaled down version of what they’d be doing on the job: an internal tool built in those exact technologies. We gave them that take home and had them work on it for a week. Then we discussed it at the onsite where we’d live-debug it and talk about architecture. I really liked this ‘Try before you buy’ style process. Because Apple really wants you to be productive in week 2, if not at the end of week 1.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“If by the fourth round, the hiring manager has gotten consistent feedback that doesn’t meet the bar, then they’d end the onsite early and reject the candidate.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Privacy isn't just a buzzword. We are obsessed with it. To drive that part home. Because it’s so important. And as I mentioned, I was a part of a group focused on gathering user data - users here being Apple internal employees – to inform future products.\n\nEven at Apple, when we’re just getting data from internal employees, we anonymized the data. Just to practice what we preach. Privacy is huge. Another example to illustrate that is that people get fired for torrenting music.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Unless you’re interviewing for a security role, very rarely. Technical people at Apple are hired to do what they do best. They have a whole army of compliance folks and lawyers to take care of that stuff. They also have an internal police force called “InfoSec”, which is the team which takes care of the secrecy stuff. Engineers are needed to do what they were hired to do: engineering.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Ask your Apple recruiter forced choice questions with two options, such as, ‘Is this coding round more of a typical LeetCode round, or more of a domain-specific open ended deep dive into a specific technology?’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nApple’s interview types in detail\n---------------------------------\n\nInterviewers can ask whatever behavioral, coding, or system design questions they want; there is no standardization for Apple interview questions. However, before an interview loop takes place, some teams will do a quick, informal assignment of what kinds of questions each interviewer is supposed to ask so that they don’t all end up asking the same things.\n\nMoreover, Apple interviewers are untrained, and as soon as a senior engineer is hired they can start conducting interviews.\n\nApple’s unpredictable nature makes it so some of their interview rounds can’t be categorized into behavioral, coding, or system design. Is a philosophical question about products a behavioral question? Not really. But they might ask one in a behavioral round. Are rapid fire infrastructure-focused open-ended trivia questions more system design or coding? It depends.\n\nFor example, here’s how one Apple interviewer describes the behind-the-scenes top-down directive before an upcoming onsite. “Go find a question that would be a good one to ask for our team.” That interviewer then ran it up the chain to an engineer above them. Then, that question immediately got asked in the next interview.\n\nAt Apple, each interview loop is specific to the needs of individual hiring managers – there is no canonical “Apple interview”, and everything is “made to order” for each specific team. That makes it difficult for candidates to prepare.",

Other times, they’ll spend the whole round deep diving into a specific technology/use case that’s relevant for their team. For example, a team that wrote in Java and did a lot of work with concurrency had a whole round focused on concurrency in Java!\n\nOther teams do medium-ish LeetCode-style questions.\n\nAt the end of the day, these interviews vary so widely it’s hard to give a specific directive, other than: ask your recruiter. For senior and above candidates, it’s more about demonstrating competence rather than needing to ace the question.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Apple’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Apple coding interview preparation resources](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple#apple-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\n\" below.",

          "content": "### Behavioral Apple’s most important round is usually behavioral or system design. Behavioral rounds are more important than coding rounds. An interesting paradox at Apple is: they highly value behavioral rounds but they don’t have a standardized way to assess candidates in those interviews Because Apple doesn’t standardize their interviews, they’re particularly prone to bias. Sometimes the top down guidance to Apple interviewers is something like: “In the behavioral round, just see if you like them. See if you’d like to get a beer with them.” Even if rounds aren’t standardized, you will definitely be asked “Why Apple?”, and your answer needs to be on point. Some interviewers reject candidates solely for not having a good answer to this question. “Why Apple?” isn’t always a single question; they can spread this out into multiple questions and drill down on this for a good portion of a behavioral round. You can also expect other motivation-based (or “why”) questions. Apple wants to hire candidates whose lives have integrated with the Apple products. And the reverse is true too. It's a fatal flaw to say, “I've never used an iPhone or a Macbook or an iPad” because those people clearly haven’t integrated Apple products deeply in their lives. Apple knows what they like, and they like their products! That doesn’t mean all you have to do is gush about the products to pass the behavioral round. It means you have to tell a genuine story which connects you and Apple products or services. Ideally, a story they will remember. Another behavioral factor debated among Apple interviewers is whether or not they agree with the idea that Apple is “cult-ish.” Our theory is that Apple is more likely to reward employees (and candidates) who act like the leader. [If you listen to 1:00:36 - 1:02:05 in an interview with Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3636) , you’ll see some stark similarities to how Apple interviewers talk about the organization. In this clip, he says, “You know how many committees we have? None. We are organized like a startup.” He then describes the benefits of silos and dividing things up. Privacy and politics are the natural consequence of a place intentionally designed to be siloed and divided up and kept separate. It’s a cost that Apple accepts because the gain is increased productivity. Put people in closed systems (teams and orgs that don’t talk to other teams and orgs) and watch them get more done. This system works like blinders on a racehorse: it keeps vision focused down the track, on the goal, minimizing peripheral distraction. That’s all they need to see and they run/work faster because of it. One final aspect of Apple’s behavioral rounds is that they will ask you specific questions about relevant skills. For example, if a team works with big data, they will ask specifically about a time you have worked with large-scale distributed systems in the context of your answer. If you don’t have direct experience with the field, they will try to get as close as possible, like asking you for what tradeoffs you’ve made when choosing a storage system. These behavioral interview questions serve two purposes: showing you have had relevant experience in the context of what the team is hiring for and trying to get you to talk about a particular behavioral skill (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution). In system design rounds, Apple interviewers love to hear about reliability. If you don’t know what else to talk about, dig into reliability. #### Tip to get unstuck “In behavioral, you gotta be a rockstar. You gotta be a leader. If you’re abrasive, or if you’re not a cultural fit, how are you going to lead the juniors? And system design is going to weigh a little more than behavioral. If you can’t code or if you’re a little rusty –if you’re good at system design and behavioral–we’ll forgive the subpar coding rounds.” #### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer “Towards the end of my career at Apple, we had a huge need for mobile developers. People who were able to do iOS apps. I was part of an R&D team. We mainly built web products in the beginning, but towards the end of my career we started doing more mobile stuff. We didn't want to hire someone who could only do mobile. We wanted someone who would be half as good at mobile stuff and half as good at web stuff, so they could plug themselves in anywhere. If the interview process was standardized across the whole company - you can imagine how hard that would be to test specifically for the niche skill set we needed. Within two days we cooked up a whole new homework assignment just for the ios candidates, we cooked up a whole new set of interview questions. We kept the behavioral part the same. But the technical part - we flipped it over just like that. And it was really good. We changed the way we graded, we were able to filter candidates based on the new set of questions. It was just fast. We didn't get any pushback from HR. We didn't have to work with compliance. We just did it. Really fast. Really nimble.” #### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer “\\[Interviews are never standardized.\\] And i’ll tell you why. Apple is a very secretive company. Everything is on a need to know basis. Also, it's a hugely political place. It was good for me because I understood the game. I didn’t blame the players I played the game. For those who understand the intricacies of politics, and simply accept the fact that it will happen when you have all Type-A people being paid a tremendous amount of money to do shitty little things, it's bound to happen. You have to accept it or you’re not going to play the game. Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another.",

Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another. That's actually one of the strengths and weaknesses of Apple. We double effort for sure. But that doesn't matter to Tim Cook. They have billions of dollars to afford this – not a problem. I also really liked how it was siloed because teams and their priorities change, leadership changes, a lot of things change. Being able to decouple from the greater company enabled them to become one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech company in the world.” #### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer “A common red flag is giving generic answers to the ‘Why Apple?’ questions. If I didn't feel their passion or if they’re just treating Apple as another job, that’s usually a red flag for me regardless of their technical competence. They really have to somehow convince me – and this is an emotional response they have to bring out of me – they really have to convince me they really want to work at Apple, they really want to roll up their sleeves, and they really believe in our values: delighting the customer, sweating the details. Making awesome products… We only care about that. We don't care about anything else. That emotional response has to be drawn from me and if they don’t then I’m likely to say, ‘They were good but meh.’” #### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer “I can tell you about a great answer one candidate had for ‘Why Apple?”. He said something like… His wife and him were university students dating across two continents. This person said they shared a recent feature – I think it was like when you facetime and you can watch video in sync – he shared how that changed his life. His wife and him went through the whole international relationship because of that. That significantly helped their relationship.” #### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer “Apple cares most about the ‘Why’. You see that rooted deeply in every apple person's DNA. ‘Why Apple?’ Right? I guess this is where people get this notion of Apple being a ‘cult-ish’ company. Much like Tesla, actually. They have a huge customer following, but you also see the same pattern with their employees. Actually, I totally subscribe to this ideology. Because you want a person you work with day in and day out to have that same passion. Sometimes you're going to have to work overtime. You're not going to get paid extra for that. Sometimes you're going to work weekends. Sometimes shit’s gonna hit the fan. You don't want to work with someone who whines about it. #### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer How Apple makes hiring decisions -------------------------------- As evidenced by the highest chaos score, Apple doesn’t do many things in hiring consistently, across the whole company. One trend is that Apple teams rely on post-interview live discussions to make hiring decisions. This varies from somewhat informal (compared to the rest of FAANG) to laughably informal. Because of the informal decision-making process and reliance on live discussion, managing the impressions of your interviewers is more important at Apple than at other FAANG. In these decision-making meetings, if there’s dissent, they strive for consensus. The people on one side try to convince the other side. This process can last 15-30 minutes on average; all FAANG companies say interviewers fight for candidates, but Apple tends to fight more than most of them. Because of their patterns of live-discussions and striving for consensus, Apple interviewers are more likely to fight for or against you (if your performance was on the fence) than any other FAANG, except _maybe_ Netflix. Ultimately, the hiring manager for that particular role has the most say, which means that that’s the person you should be working to impress the most. “Post-onsite feedback for my org was 100% live discussions. At Apple I never had to write feedback. Which made me do more interviews. We made the decision on the same day. Everyone had to make a decision at the end of the day. Do an onsite, then at 5pm, we gather in a single meeting room, we do on the count of three: thumbs up, down, or in the middle. Then we talk after seeing the thumbs. And try to convince the people on the other side. If there’s less than 5 thumbs-up, then that might be an instant rejection. If there’s 6 or 7 or more thumbs up, the ‘thumbs up’ people try to convince the other side. Or in that same situation, the 3 or 4 thumbs down will try to convince the other side.” #### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer “My manager wanted to hire this person. But he failed my interview so badly. I didn't want to argue with my manager but at the same time I didn't want to work with this person. Because we are hiring people we’d work with on a daily basis. So arguments happen a lot. And in this case, I was the only ‘no’ on the board and the candidate got rejected.” #### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer Apple coding interview preparation resources -------------------------------------------- We’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Apple content for you!

You’ll be asked to provide 3 different times that you’re available so you can be more, or less, aggressive in how you approach it.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAffirm’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s more about prep for the hiring process than anything else. You might be asked about your interest in Affirm, and they will likely talk about the role you are applying for.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nAffirm’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in HackerRank.\n\nWe will cover what we know of their question style in the section called “Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Affirm” [below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-types)\n.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nYou can do the onsite section in one day or over two days.\n\n*   **Behavioral** (45 mins). This is with the hiring manager of the team you are interviewing with. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This will be conducted in HackerRank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Second coding** (1 hour). As above.\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This will also be conducted in Hackerrank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/affirm-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Affirm\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nAffirm’s coding questions are pretty straightforward and will be familiar to anyone practicing on LeetCode. You can commonly find them online. That said, their interviewers will try to put their own spin on questions – expect some variations, but if you can solve medium LeetCode problems, you should be fine.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Affirm interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Affirm engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Recursion](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=recursion)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis round won’t be a completely generic system design interview. It will usually relate to Affirm’s business. Expect questions about databases, multiple layers of schema, and functional design.\n\nYou might be asked to design a system that enables transactions between two users via their bank accounts but that has certain constraints built-in e.g., they can’t transfer more than what is in their account.\n\nTiming is important here. You won’t have enough time to go into everything in detail. Try to cover everything at a high level, and ask your interviewer which areas would be most interesting to delve into more thoroughly.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nExpect the standard behavioral questions here. Questions like:\n\n*   Have you ever felt pressure at work? How did you handle it?\n*   When have you worked on a good team? Can you describe why it was good?\n*   Have you ever received criticism from leadership at work?\n\nThis round is important as it is conducted by your potential manager. You can do well in the coding rounds but still fail out if you don’t perform well in the behavioral interview.\n\n### How Affirm Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nAll the interviewers submit their feedback, and the decision is made by the hiring manager.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Affirm?

There is also a huge emphasis on culture fit, much more so than at most other companies of their size and stage.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAirbnb’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Airbnb, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nGenerally, there’s only one technical phone screen, but if your interviewer didn’t get enough signal in the first one, you may be asked to do one more. Airbnb uses [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/)\n to conduct technical interviews, and in these interviews you’re expected to write working code and run it – pseudocode is not allowed, and the expectation is that you’re extremely proficient in your language of choice.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite at Airbnb consists of 5-7 interview rounds with the following steps:\n\n*   Coding (1-3 hours)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Behavioral (1 hour)\n*   Culture Fit (2 hours)\n\n#### Coding\n\nAs with the technical phone screen, you’ll have to write working code and run it (no pseudocode). The number of rounds is dependent on your level, so more senior engineers will have less coding interviews, but more system design.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThis interview is similar to [Google’s system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThis interview will touch on your past projects, contributions, how you work in teams, and so on. The core engineering culture at Airbnb is all about making your mark and owning your impact.\n\n#### Culture Fit\n\nAirbnb calls these “Host interviews”, and they’re conducted by non-engineers. These interviews are very important, even if you do well on the technical portion, fail these and you won't get an offer. They'll be evaluating whether or not you’d be a good culture fit with everyone at Airbnb, and how you embody their values:\n\n*   Champion the mission\n*   Be a host\n*   Embrace the adventure\n*   Be a cereal entrepreneur\n\n### Step 4: Team matching\n\nOnce you’ve passed your onsite, you can expect to speak with anywhere from 1 to 4 hiring managers. The hiring managers will try to sell you on joining their team, but will also use the time to decide if you’re ultimately a good fit for their specific org.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Airbnb\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nAirbnb asks LeetCode-style questions, ranging from medium to hard difficulty.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Airbnb interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Airbnb interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.

One engineer we spoke to who recently went through the process told us:\n\n> _They seem to tailor the interviewing process to what you say you’re interested in at the company during the early rounds, so be careful about what you say you want. Stick to what you’re good at._\n\nFrom our conversations, it seems that in certain cases you do interview for a specific role, but you could end up on multiple teams depending on how the process goes. If you are interviewing for a specific role, we were told by another engineer that you should:\n\n> _Read up about their product and the relationship between the role and the product, they will ask questions very specific to the role and product._\n\nSome of the engineers we spoke with had a hiring manager call instead of a technical phone screen, and some got both. More on that below.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   They might ask you how comfortable you’d be working in the defense industry.\n*   LeetCode practice will help, as their coding problems are at a LeetCode medium level, although they like to add practical elements too.\n*   If you’re going for a role that involves robotics, you need to know robotics in detail, particularly for L5/L6 level roles. They will press you to discuss the technical aspects of robotics even if your main question is more coding or system design based.\n*   They don’t tend to hire for remote roles.\n\nThe entire process takes about 3-4 weeks, and we’ve heard it’s more enjoyable than the typical FAANG style interview process. From one of our users who recently interviewed with Anduril:\n\n> _Their entire process seemed less formal than FAANG, more personable, more conversational._\n\nThey seem to be OK to move at your speed through the process. We’ve heard it can be done in as little as two weeks but that they don’t have a problem with you slowing things down.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAndurils’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Anduril, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also sometimes ask you about your qualms, if any, about working in the defence industry.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen / Hiring Manager Call\n\nSometimes you’ll get one or both of these. It seems to depend on the role you are interviewing for.\n\nIf you get the standard technical phone screen, you can expect LeetCode medium-level questions. It will be algorithms and data structures based, but they will put it into an Anduril context, e.g., drone management. One engineer told us:\n\n> _The question is not difficult algorithmically, but the follow-up questions in terms of how to speed and scale it up were trickier._\n\nIf you end up getting the hiring manager call instead, the objective will be to show you are a fit for the role, technically speaking. They’ll ask questions about your resume and experience before throwing in a coding question that is practical for the role in question.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly by role but here’s what you can expect.\n\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Second coding** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad or on a whiteboard if you go in person. They also sometimes use the whiteboard feature in Zoom. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/anduril-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Anduril\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThis will likely be algorithms and data structures-focused but will skew more practical than typical LeetCode questions. A sample question we heard was about a collection of robots, where they had tasks to perform, and you needed to keep track of the highest priority tasks. Others involved drone management or graph manipulation\n\nYou will have two coding rounds, and they’ll be quite similar.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Anduril. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Anduril engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nYou might get a pretty industry standard question here, or it could be very practical, depending on the role you are interviewing for. Some of the standard questions we’ve heard are:\n\n*   Design Tinyurl\n*   Design Tetris\n\nIf you get a more practical round, it might be related to managing drones in the field, where you have to get a signal from the drone and then send it back instructions. If you get a practical question, you need to be prepared to discuss the technologies, hardware included at least at a high level.

That said, it will still include the questions you’d expect in a behavioral interview. They will go over your resume and ask you about projects you’ve worked on in the past. Expect questions about the projects you’ve worked on and areas like:\n\n*   Their scale and scope\n*   Technical challenges and how you solved them\n*   Conflict that arose and how you handled it\n\nYou might also learn more about the type of projects they are working on for the team you are being matched with or interviewing for. If so you’ll have the chance to ask questions, but you’ll also be asked how you’d see yourself fit into the role.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Your interviewers will all come from that org. There is likely some flexibility in terms of which team in that org you end up on.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   Brush up on system design\n*   Though Anthropic’s coding questions are algorithmic, they tend to be more practical than the verbatim LeetCode questions that many companies use\n*   Use a larger monitor for your coding Challenge – time is of the essence, and a laptop has limited real estate to view and write code\n*   They don’t give exploding offers and are very patient through the process\n*   They use Python, and you’ll need to be comfortable with it\n\nThe entire process takes about 3-4 weeks, and we’ve heard it’s very well thought out. From one of our users who recently interviewed with Anthropic:\n\n> _This felt so easy and thoughtful compared to all the other companies I interviewed with. They have their shit together. Efficient, thoughtful, won’t waste your time. They move faster than expected!_\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAnthropic’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Anthropic, your understanding of Anthropic’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also explain that they are a B Corp and cover what that means.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Coding Challenge\n\nWe’ve heard that this can be done live or asynchronously. Most of the people we spoke to took a 90-minute take-home assessment in CodeSignal, but Anthropic's website says you might get a 60-minute live assessment, so it seems to be role-dependent. It won’t be a LeetCode-style problem, but will still be pretty straightforward. You will be asked to complete a task that gets progressively more complex. One challenge we heard about was to implement a bank with multiple transaction types. You would have to build the core business logic for the application. We’ve heard that candidates tend to run out of time in this round, so manage your time carefully.\n\nOne engineer who took the take-home assessment told us that:\n\n> _The screening was conducted on Code Signal, consisting of a general specification and a black-box evaluator. There were four levels. The spec would get more complicated at each level, and your code had to pass all the tests at one level to get to the next level. All in two hours._\n> \n> _The verbal spec was straightforward. No special algorithmic knowledge was needed. But the spec interpretation could only be obtained by repeatedly running your code to see what test cases failed._\n> \n> _Makes me think the folks who go to the next level are probably good at reading ambiguous specs and trying out theories against black-box graders._\n\n### Step 3: Hiring Manager Call\n\nThis is mostly a technical call and is usually split into two parts. You will be asked to talk about (1) a project you’ve completed and (2) review code examples in different programming languages. You’ll be asked to detect issues and recognize what task the code is used for.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly by role but here’s what you can expect.\n\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-coding)\n     below.\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in the drawing tool of your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-design)\n     below.\n*   **Second coding (role-specific)**(1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-coding)\n     below.\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/anthropic-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n     below.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Anthropic\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThis will likely be algorithms and data structures-focused but will skew more practical than typical LeetCode questions. A sample question we heard was about iterating over and debugging a call stack.\n\nMost coding rounds are carried out in a shared Python environment, so you’ll need to be comfortable with the syntax and standard library. Some roles will incorporate Machine Learning elements but only in one of the coding rounds and you can pass on that if you’d like. You do not have to know anything about machine learning to interview with Anthropic as an engineer. Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Anthropic interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Anthropic engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.\n\nFirst, here’s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to Anthropic:\n\n*   Data mutation\n*   Concurrency\n\nAnd here are technical topics that you’re likely to find at other companies as well (for these we’ve created detailed write-ups of their own):\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nAs with the other interviews, expect something practical here. It will very likely be related to an issue that Anthropic has encountered before. You might be asked to:\n\n*   Design a system that enables a GPT to handle multiple questions in a single thread\n*   Design a Claude chat service\n*   Design a banking app\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis will be more conversational and less traditional than you might have seen at other companies. Expect questions about AI in areas like ethics, data protection, safety, the job market and knowledge sharing.\n\n### How Anthropic Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nDecisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn’t possible, the hiring manager has final say.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Most of the people we spoke to took a 90-minute take-home assessment in CodeSignal, but Anthropic's website says you might get a 60-minute live assessment, so it seems to be role-dependent. It won’t be a LeetCode-style problem, but will still be pretty straightforward. You will be asked to complete a task that gets progressively more complex. One challenge we heard about was to implement a bank with multiple transaction types. You would have to build the core business logic for the application. We’ve heard that candidates tend to run out of time in this round, so manage your time carefully.\n\nOne engineer who took the take-home assessment told us that:\n\n> _The screening was conducted on Code Signal, consisting of a general specification and a black-box evaluator. There were four levels. The spec would get more complicated at each level, and your code had to pass all the tests at one level to get to the next level. All in two hours._\n> \n> _The verbal spec was straightforward. No special algorithmic knowledge was needed. But the spec interpretation could only be obtained by repeatedly running your code to see what test cases failed._\n> \n> _Makes me think the folks who go to the next level are probably good at reading ambiguous specs and trying out theories against black-box graders._",

A sample question we heard was about iterating over and debugging a call stack.\n\nMost coding rounds are carried out in a shared Python environment, so you’ll need to be comfortable with the syntax and standard library. Some roles will incorporate Machine Learning elements but only in one of the coding rounds and you can pass on that if you’d like. You do not have to know anything about machine learning to interview with Anthropic as an engineer. Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Anthropic interviews.

You’ll be interviewed by people from different teams during the interview loop.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   Their coding questions are discoverable online – they have a set bank that they use\n*   You can use any language for the coding rounds and your own IDE\n*   They have published their own [guide to the engineering hiring process](https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers/resources/interviewing/how-to-nail-your-engineering-interview)\n    \n*   They hire remotely, but salaries are location-specific\n\nThe entire process takes about 4-6 weeks.\n\nAn engineer familiar with their hiring process told us that Atlassian’s “[Chaos Score](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process#the-chaos-score)\n is very low, i.e., there is a high level of consistency in terms of process and outcomes for different candidates.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nAtlassian’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Atlassian, and how the teams you’ve worked on before have been structured. They’ll also discuss the possible roles that are available.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen via Karat\n\nAtlassian uses a third-party interview service called Karat to conduct the technical screen that comes before the onsite. This seems to be true for most engineering roles but not all. If you haven’t been interviewed by Karat before, you’ll be interviewed by an engineer who does NOT work for Atlassian but who’s getting paid by Karat to conduct interviews on their behalf.\n\nIf you are interviewing for a backend or full stack engineering role, you’ll get a coding question. It will be a LeetCode-style, medium-level question selected from Atlassian’s question bank. You can find examples of the types of questions they ask online.\n\nIf you aren’t interviewing for a backend or full stack engineering role, we’ve heard that this can be a coding round OR a system design round and may be conducted by an Atlassian engineer, rather than an outsourced third party like Karat. If that ends up being the case, you will be able to use your own IDE or tooling, whatever language you’d prefer, and even any developer tools you use during your day-to-day, outside of AI technologies.\n\nIf you get a system design round, you might be asked to design something like a task list or job scheduler. You’ll be able to use any tooling you’d like to build the system. It’s really important to show how you are thinking about the problem by asking good questions, discussing tradeoffs and constraints, and mentioning both technologies and internal partners you might use to achieve your goal.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly by role but here’s what you can expect during the back-end and full-stack hiring loops.\n\n*   **Coding x 2** (60 mins each). These interviews will be conducted in your IDE of choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-coding)\n     below.\n*   **System design** (60 mins). This interview will be conducted in the drawing tool of your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/atlassian-interview-questions#question-design)\n     below.\n*   **Values** (45 mins).

Except something that feels like a LeetCode medium-level question.\n\nThey are trying to test out how you would approach a problem if you encountered it at work, so you’re able to use the language and tooling you are comfortable with. They are assessing you based on 5 key criteria:\n\n1.  Code Quality: Clean up your code as you go and act as if it is eventually going into production.\n2.  Adaptability: Be prepared to be given additional requirements to incorporate as you go and be open to change when it makes sense.\n3.  Conceptual Thinking: Break down the problem in components and discuss it in conceptual terms before you start to solve it.\n4.  Decision Making: They put more focus on why you approach a problem from a certain angle than whether you solve it. Discuss the pros and cons of your decisions.\n5.  Resourcefulness: They want to see how you use your experience and other resources to solve problems when needed.\n\nBe prepared to discuss how to scale your solution as well!\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Atlassian interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Atlassian engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Priority Queues](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=priority-queues)\n\n[Search](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nAgain, you can use any tooling you’d like for this round. You might be asked to:\n\n*   Design a job scheduler\n*   Design a task list\n*   Design a tagging system\n\nThis is a pretty standard system design interview. You won’t need to code anything and the focus will be on how you would build the system and the tradeoffs, considerations and optimizations that might be involved.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Values\n\nThis interview can be conducted by anyone at the company. You might talk to someone from Marketing, Sales or any other department. It will feature scenario-based behavioral questions. They prefer the STAR framework for answering questions, so brush up on that methodology. It’s a good idea to review [Atlassian’s values](https://www.atlassian.com/company/values)\n and incorporate them into your answers. Expect questions about how you’ve handled giving and getting feedback, how you’ve worked on teams, etc.\n\n### Manager Interview\n\nThis is another behavioral interview, this time with an engineering manager, and it will be a deep dive into a past project you’ve worked on with a team, so be sure to prepare. The types of questions that you get here will focus on things you learned while working as part of a team and the scale and scope of your impact. They will ask questions around conflict resolution, the lessons you’ve learned, how you’ve mentored others, and how you were able to drive outcomes. Again, knowing Atlassian’s values, and incorporating them into your answers will help.\n\n### How Atlassian Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nDecisions are made by a hiring committee. We don’t have a lot of information on their process but we do know that they sometimes ask you to complete an additional round if you didn’t quite meet the bar during the onsite.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

This seems to be true for most engineering roles but not all. If you haven’t been interviewed by Karat before, you’ll be interviewed by an engineer who does NOT work for Atlassian but who’s getting paid by Karat to conduct interviews on their behalf.\n\nIf you are interviewing for a backend or full stack engineering role, you’ll get a coding question. It will be a LeetCode-style, medium-level question selected from Atlassian’s question bank. You can find examples of the types of questions they ask online.\n\nIf you aren’t interviewing for a backend or full stack engineering role, we’ve heard that this can be a coding round OR a system design round and may be conducted by an Atlassian engineer, rather than an outsourced third party like Karat. If that ends up being the case, you will be able to use your own IDE or tooling, whatever language you’d prefer, and even any developer tools you use during your day-to-day, outside of AI technologies.\n\nIf you get a system design round, you might be asked to design something like a task list or job scheduler. You’ll be able to use any tooling you’d like to build the system. It’s really important to show how you are thinking about the problem by asking good questions, discussing tradeoffs and constraints, and mentioning both technologies and internal partners you might use to achieve your goal.",

Adaptability: Be prepared to be given additional requirements to incorporate as you go and be open to change when it makes sense.\n3.

Although you apply for a specific team from the get-go, your interviews will likely not be with the people on your team – interviewers are randomly selected from a pool – except for the hiring manager interview.\n\nNote: Square is one of the few companies that will actually give you some constructive post-interview feedback!\n\nThe entire process takes about 6 weeks, based on our sources.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nSquare’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Square, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements.\n\nIt’s really important to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nSquare’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. In rare cases, they will let very senior candidates skip this step. In this interview, you’ll pair with your interviewer on a coding problem in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/)\n.\n\nAfter this round is over, you’ll get high-level feedback about your performance from your recruiter, regardless of outcome (e.g., you might get feedback about your coding speed, your attention to detail, and so on).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite at Square consists of 4-5 sessions, depending on the role and experience level of the candidate. Most of the interviews, except for the hiring manager interview and the coding rounds, are two-person panels. If you’re a mid to senior-level engineer, you can expect the onsite to look something like this:\n\n*   Coding (2 hours)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   (For L6+) Leadership interview (1 hour)\n*   Hiring manager interview (30 minutes)\n\n#### Coding\n\nSquare’s onsite includes two separate 1-hour coding interviews, conducted in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/)\n.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThis round is conducted by a two-person panel.\n\n#### (For L6+) Leadership Interview\n\nThis round is conducted by a panel of two very senior engineers (both will be L6 and above).\n\n#### Hiring Manager Interview\n\nThis is a call with a hiring manager from the team you’d be working on. For more junior engineers, it usually takes the form of a “Teach me something technical”. For more senior engineers, it’s usually a deep-dive into a relevant project you’ve worked on in the past.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Square\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nCoding questions at Square are practical, e.g., “Build an app to split a bill with friends”, rather than LeetCode-style. Square has a question bank with approved questions that interviewers can pull from, and they can submit their own questions to it as well, though there’s a rigorous review process:\n\n*   You propose your question\n*   It gets approved by other interviewers\n*   You try out your question in the wild, and it gets shadowed as well\n*   Once it’s fully approved, it goes into a company-wide question bank\n\nInterviewers are also encouraged to layer complexity in their interviews, and a question that might start out simple can go to unexpected places.\n\nSquare’s questions, while practical, may touch on the following technical topics/concepts, as you’ll need them to build whatever it is your interviewer tasks you with:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Sets](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sets)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Queues](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=queue)\n\n### System Design\n\nThese will likely be high-level [system design questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n, and though it’s now retired, one of the more common system design questions at Square was “Design a Hotel booking system”.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\nCommon Square Interview Questions\n---------------------------------\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Square ask on our platform.

Those are then collected and sent to the hiring manager, who will decide whether to “plead your case” in front of the Hiring Bar (Square’s version of a hiring committee).\n\nNote that you can get mixed feedback from your interviewers and still get moved forward. It really depends on what the hiring manager needs and what they can justify.\n\nSquare’s Hiring Bar is composed of 3 people – either eng managers or senior engineers. Your hiring manager takes your resume and interview results and explains why you’d be an asset to their team. Then the Hiring Bar votes, and if you get at least 2 of the 3 votes, you get an offer.\n\nSquare Interview Replays\n------------------------\n\n[![Threaded order of execution](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Square_1_5015750c0d.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nBlock/Square Interviewer\\\n\\\nThreaded order of execution\\\n\\\nEponymous Squirrel, a Block/Square engineer, interviewed Dystopian Sphinx in Python](https://interviewing.io/mocks/square-python-threaded-order-of-execution)\n\n[![Sleep sort](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Square_2_08692ecf13.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nBlock/Square Interviewer\\\n\\\nSleep sort\\\n\\\nEponymous Squirrel, a Block/Square engineer, interviewed The Phenomenal Lemur in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/square-java-sleep-sort)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Block/Square?

Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](https://interviewing.io/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\nBloomberg’s Interview Process & Questions\n=========================================\n\nPublished:\n\nBloomberg’s interview process is completely decentralized. Each team asks its own questions, focuses on different things, and might have slightly different processes – for instance, some teams don’t ask any system design questions.\n\nLike many other decentralized companies (e.g., [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n), you can apply to and interview with multiple teams simultaneously. However, all teams have access to the same applicant tracking system, so it’s possible that if you’ve done poorly with many teams already, subsequent teams may decline to interview you. From what we’ve heard, however, there’s no real downside in hedging your bets and talking to as many teams as possible.\n\nIf you do decide to interview with multiple teams, you’ll have to repeat the entire process below every time.\n\nGeneral tips for your Bloomberg interviews:\n\n*   Do lots of algorithms and data structures practice\n*   Be ready to interview in Java or C++\n*   Read up on what Bloomberg does before your interviews, and have a good answer for Why Bloomberg?\n\n![Bloomberg’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Bloomberg_s_Company_Process_6b61d23f61.png)\n\nBloomberg’s Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Bloomberg can expect the following process:\n\n*   Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n*   Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n*   Onsite (4 hours)\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nBloomberg's recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Bloomberg, your understanding of Bloomberg’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nBloomberg’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted on Zoom and HackerRank. Algorithms and data structures are typically the areas of focus. Unlike at many other companies, you will not be running your code during the interview, so it’s OK if it’s not syntactically perfect, as long as it’s efficient and largely correct.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe Bloomberg hiring process is all virtual, and they break the onsite up into individual sections – once you get through the first technical phone screen, you are essentially at the onsite phase but will have to pass each interview to get to the next.\n\nDuring the virtual onsite, you will use Zoom and HackerRank for all the sessions. The topics will vary team by team, so you may get system design questions or algorithms & data structures questions during the technical rounds, or a combination of both. It is possible to only get coding questions and not have to do any system design – the details vary from team to team.\n\n*   **Technical interview** (1 hour). Just like in the phone screen, you won’t have to run your code. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the “Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Bloomberg” section [below.](https://interviewing.io/bloomberg-interview-questions#question-types)\n    \n*   **Technical interview** (1 hour). As above.\n*   **Behavioral interview** (1 hour). This will be a test of your soft skills by the HR team. Cultural fit is very important to them, so have a well-thought-out answer as to why you want to be there.\n*   **Final interview with a senior manager** (1 hour). This will be your final interview and it will be conducted by a senior manager, someone who manages at least 50 engineers at Bloomberg. Some of the questions may be technical, others behavioral. Details depend on both the manager and the team.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Bloomberg\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nEach team has its own questions, and there is no central bank. Some teams only ask coding questions, but others will mix in system design questions. Your questions might be in C++ or Python depending on the team. Most teams at Bloomberg use C++. Senior people should know C++ going in, though Java also works. Not knowing either of these languages isn’t a deal-breaker, but it can be a tiebreaker when deciding between two candidates who did well otherwise.\n\n### Coding\n\nAs there is no central bank of questions, each team and each interviewer will pull questions from elsewhere. This could be from LeetCode, previous companies they’ve worked at, or questions they’ve seen before at Bloomberg.\n\nMostly, you should expect standard algorithms and data structures questions in this round. To figure out what technical topics might come up in your Bloomberg interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Bloomberg interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter.\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Linked Lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 13  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=depth-first-search)\n\n[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=breadth-first-search)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nSystem Design questions at Bloomberg tend to skew practical and tend to be finance-related. For instance, you might be asked questions such as: How would you design a stock exchange?. Unlike other companies, you might be asked to write code during this interview.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis will be a pretty standard behavioral interview conducted by someone from the HR team. Expect questions about your past experience and some situational scenarios, e.g., _How would you handle conflict in the office?_\n\nIt’s also very important to do your homework and read up on Bloomberg and what they do, so you can effectively answer questions about why you want to work there.\n\n### How Bloomberg Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nTheir interviewing team will sync after each stage of the onsite process and do a debrief. This will determine whether or not you pass through. It’s possible to be sent home after any of the onsite rounds.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Bloomberg?

If there are multiple hiring managers interested, you’ll have an opportunity to chat with them after your onsite and make a choice of team.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, where they’ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you’re interested in Capital One. They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Online Assessment\n\nCapital One’s online assessment consists of three LeetCode-style algorithms and data structure questions: one easy, one medium, and one hard, administered via CodeSignal. You get 1.5 hours to complete it.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite aka “Power Day”\n\nCapital One’s onsite lasts roughly 4 hours and consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Coding (1 hour)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Behavioral (1 hour)\n*   Case study (1 hour)\n\n#### Coding\n\nThis interview takes about an hour and focuses on algorithms and data structures. You’ll share your screen with the interviewer (usually over Zoom) and code in whatever environment you usually work in. Capital one’s preferred languages are JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, Python, and Go.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThis is a one hour interview. The expectation here is that you’ll be able to go in-depth on your design choices and that your design needs to be as functional as possible, given the interview time allotted. One common mistake we heard about from one of our interviewers at this step is that people get hung up on trying to perfect a small piece of their solution instead of getting to an end-to-end solution that works. With that in mind, make sure that you’re able to articulate your assumptions and call out any shortcomings in your design.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThis interview can either happen live, in which case it lasts one hour, or in some cases it’ll be an asynchronous online assessment. In both cases, it’s pretty standard behavioral fare – you’ll get questions with the expectation that you’ll answer using the [STAR format](https://capd.mit.edu/resources/the-star-method-for-behavioral-interviews)\n.\n\n#### Case Study\n\nIn this interview, you’ll be presented with a hypothetical situation and asked to develop a solution to the underlying business problem. This interview evaluates your communication skills and business sense, as well as your ability to think logically and quantitatively. It’s important to be aware of [Capital One’s values](https://www.capitalonecareers.com/culture)\n and incorporate them into your responses.\n\n### Step 4: Team Matching\n\nOnce you finish your onsite, your interviewers will submit their hire/no hire recommendations. If you were matched with only one team, you’ll be extended an offer. If you matched with multiple teams, you’ll have a brief chat with each of the hiring managers, so that you have an opportunity to decide where to go, at which point the offer will be extended officially.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Capital One\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThis interview usually has two medium-difficulty LeetCode-style questions.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Capital One interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Capital One interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Linked Lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 13  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Dynamic Programming](https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=dynamic-programming)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nThe focus of this interview depends on the interviewer and your seniority.

This means you can interview with multiple teams although they sometimes allow you to skip stages if they feel like they’d be duplicating their efforts. There doesn’t seem to be any downside to interviewing for more than one role at a time. In fact, if you end up interviewing for multiple teams, you may be able to skip steps (e.g. not have to repeat CodeSignal).\n\nA good way to get into the process with Coinbase is to find a role you like and then track down the lead recruiter or hiring manager aligned to it on Linkedin. Recruiters will also share candidates they like with other teams if they don’t have a slot open on their specific team.\n\nGeneral tips for your Coinbase interviews:\n\n*   It’s OK to reach out to your recruiter or hiring manager contact to ask questions\n*   If you feel like there was some miscommunication during an interview, be proactive and reach out to the recruiter afterward to clear things up\n*   Apply for the right level and don’t be too aggressive – it’s better to secure a role at a lower level than to fail out of a higher one.\n\n![Coinbase’’s interview process: CodeSignal assessment, Recruiter call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/coinbase_process_flowchart_6439ce881a.png)\n\nCoinbase’s Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Bloomberg can expect the following process:\n\n*   CodeSignal assessment (70 minutes)\n*   Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n*   Onsite (3 hours)\n\n### Step 1: CodeSignal Assessment\n\nThis is an asynchronous challenge focused on data structures and algorithms. As of the date of publication, it includes 4 questions for you to work on. The first one is usually a warm-up. The others are LeetCode medium-level.\n\n### Step 2: Recruiter call\n\nCoinbase’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Coinbase, your understanding of Coinbase’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process. Once you pass this stage you’ll enter the team pipeline.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe Coinbase onsite is usually done over two days and includes three, one-hour long interviews. You’ll do two technical interviews and one final call with a hiring manager. For the technical portions, you can use your own IDE with a screen-share, or they can provide tooling.\n\n*   **Technical interview** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the “Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Coinbase” section [below](https://interviewing.io/coinbase-interview-questions#question-types)\n    . You can typically use whatever language you want, although a few teams do require you to use a specific language.\n*   **System design interview** (1 hour). As above.\n*   **Interview with a hiring manager** (1 hour). As above\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Coinbase\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nEach team has its own questions, but there are consistencies in the type you will encounter at each stage.\n\n### Coding\n\nThis round is a “pseudo project” – you’ll be asked to build a feature, and you’ll get input data in the form of a mini database. You will have one hour to get as far as you can.\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Inorder Traversal](https://interviewing.io/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 2  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=inorder-traversal)\n\n[Maps](https://interviewing.io/maps-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/maps-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 2  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=maps)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Memoization](https://interviewing.io/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=memoization)\n\n### System Design\n\nSystem design questions at Coinbase tend to skew practical. Many questions involve setting up microservices and then showing the network topology of your chosen architecture. Basically, they will want to test your understanding of microservice architecture but through the lens of building a product.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Hiring Manager Interview\n\nThis will be your final interview, and it will be conducted by a hiring manager. You’ll likely be asked some culture fit/behavioral questions, but at this point, the hiring manager will also be trying to sell you on the role.\n\n### How Coinbase Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nTheir interviewing team will all meet after the onsite and give their feedback to the hiring manager, who will make the decision. A director will then review the decision and has the power to veto, but this very rarely happens.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Coinbase?

Candidates are typically matched to a specific part of the organization early on, and you'll interview for a specific role, but your interviewers will not necessarily be people from your future team. There is also scope to switch roles after the onsite. According to our sources, about a quarter of candidates pivot to another team after completing their onsite interviews.\n\nThe entire process can take up to 8 weeks, making it one of the longer hiring processes in the industry. Recruiters are upfront about this timeline with candidates.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   Study LeetCode questions, particularly those tagged for Databricks in the past 3 months, as some questions come directly from this pool. You’ll get LeetCode medium and hard level questions.\n*   Brush up on concurrency and multithreading concepts, which are essential for one of the coding rounds.\n*   Practice system design on Google Docs, as it is sometimes used for the system design round.\n*   Be prepared for graph algorithms and optimization problems, as these appear frequently in the coding rounds.\n*   Have impressive references ready—they're weighted heavily in the final decision process at Databricks.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nDatabricks' recruiter screen lasts about 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare.. They'll ask about your previous experience, your interest in Databricks, and go over the specific role you're applying for. At this stage, your profile (resume, referral information, location preferences) begins to be shared with engineering leads for potential team matching.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen lasts about 1 hour with an engineer. You'll use CoderPad or a similar online IDE with runnable code. Expect LeetCode-style questions, typically medium to hard difficulty. One engineer we spoke with, who had just gone through the process, told us:\n\n> _The question was one of the LeetCode questions for Databricks. I was able to find it by searching for the common Databricks questions from the past 3 months._\n\nQuestions candidates have faced include a weighted paths problem (graph optimization) and the [house robber problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/)\n, which builds in difficulty as time permits. After the technical screen, Databricks begins preliminary level mapping. For L4/L5 roles, the interview loops remain similar.\n\n### Step3: Hiring Manager Call\n\nMost candidates, particularly for senior roles, will have a 1-hour call with a hiring manager for the role they have been mapped to initially. This interview is primarily behavioral, covering your background and experience, what you've worked on and enjoy working on, and questions you have about Databricks and the specific organization. If a hiring manager is unavailable, you might be interviewed by the Director of Engineering for the organization in question.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite Interviews\n\nAt this point, candidates interview for specific teams based on their background and interests. Onsite interview loops vary slightly depending on role (ML, frontend, backend, etc.) and seniority level, but the below is generally what you'll get:\n\n*   **Coding 1: Algorithms** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad or a similar online IDE with runnable code. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Coding 2:** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Coding: Concurrency/Multithreading** (1 hour). This round focuses on implementing programs that leverage multithreading for efficiency. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding: Concurrency/Multithreading section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System Design** (1 hour). The system design interview is often conducted using Google Docs, which some candidates find unusual compared to whiteboarding or specialized diagramming tools. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Cross-functional/Behavioral** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Cross-functional/Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/databricks-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Databricks\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nDatabricks' technical questions tend to lean toward the difficult side. For coding interviews, expect LeetCode hard more than medium questions.\n\n### Coding\n\nThere are usually 3 coding rounds. Two will focus on Data Structures and Algorithms, and one might focus on concurrency and multithreading. The coding rounds that include algorithm questions are LeetCode medium or hard in terms of level. An example question we heard involved IAP to CIDR (checking if IP address ranges fit into CIDR notation). Another was a variable-sized tic-tac-toe game implementation question.\n\nCandidates report these coding rounds tend to involve tricky optimizations—you can use a brute force solution to make progress, but you should be thinking of optimizations throughout.\n\nIn the Concurrency and Multithreading coding round, you might be asked to implement an efficient logger that processes messages in a queue. This round is considered particularly challenging by most candidates. One engineer we spoke to, who is familiar with the process, told us:\n\n> _This question wasn’t on LeetCode, but preparing by solving the LeetCode questions on concurrency and multithreading will be a huge help._\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Databricks interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Databricks engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nTheir system design questions are pretty standard, but they will expand on the initial question to dig deeper into your depth of knowledge. One example we heard involved designing a service that provides customers with the cheapest copy of a book they're searching for, which requires considering integration with different book distributors, search functionality, and purchase flows.\n\nBe prepared to use Google Docs for these interviews rather than whiteboarding tools, which some candidates found unusual. This choice seems to be up to the individual interviewer, so don’t be caught off guard!\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Cross-Functional/Behavioral\n\nThis interview is with the hiring manager and includes standard behavioral questions about your past experiences and projects. The recruiter may brief you on the hiring manager's style beforehand. You’ll be asked about your past projects and explore areas of conflict resolution and teamwork. Expect questions like \"Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker\" and \"Describe a project you're most proud of,\" with deep follow-up questions on specifics.\n\n### How HubSpot Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nAfter the onsite interviews, Databricks has a thorough evaluation process that consists of multiple layers of review.\n\nReference checks are an important part of the evaluation, typically involving 1 manager and 2 more senior team members. Databricks emphasizes having impressive references, as they're weighted heavily in the final decision.\n\nNext comes the Hiring Committee review. Unlike the interview panel, this is a separate committee that reviews all aspects of your candidacy: interview feedback, background, career trajectory, and references. Our sources emphasize that the final decision is holistic, so having every aspect of your application as strong as possible is crucial.\n\nFinally, the VP of Engineering reviews the complete candidate packet and has the final say on hiring decisions. One of our sources reported failing at this step despite positive feedback in earlier rounds, suggesting that the bar remains high throughout the entire process.\n\nIn some cases, candidates might be asked to complete an additional take-home assessment after the onsite. While this is rare, it might be used when the recruiter believes it could strengthen a candidate's application. These assessments can take around 5 hours to complete and may involve specialized problems such as database challenges.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](https://interviewing.io/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\nDatadog’s Interview Process & Questions\n=======================================\n\n_The info below is based on conversations with Datadog engineers._\n\nPublished:\n\nDatadog's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Datadog can expect the following process:\n\n*   Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n*   Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n*   Onsite (4 hours)\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   Practice algorithmic questions that lean practical in terms of the type of work Datadog does (but practicing LeetCode questions will help do well in these – many of their questions start as a LeetCode medium and then layer on complexity/get more practical)\n*   Prepare to answer some technical questions about your past work during the behavioral portion of the onsite.\n\n![Datadog’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Datadog_Interview_Process_db7ec1616e.png)\n\nAt Datadog, the process is centralized, which means that you won’t do team matching until after the onsite phase. You’ll be interviewed by people from different teams during the interview loop.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6 weeks, and we’ve heard it can seem quite slow at times. You might have to push to speed things up.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nDatadog’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Datadog, and what you’re looking for moving forward.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nDatadog’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in CoderPad. You will get two questions in this interview. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [“Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Datadog” below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-types)\n.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nOnsite interview loops can vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get.\n\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **\\[Only for roles below Staff\\] Second coding** (1 hour). As above.\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in your choice of tool (many candidates choose Excalidraw). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager or director of engineering. It may feature some technical questions! For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/datadog-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n     .\n*   **\\[For Staff level roles and above\\] Presentation** (1 hour). This will replace one of the coding rounds. You will be asked to present a project you’ve worked on in the past to a panel. You’ll be expected to justify the technical decisions involved and explain the business context or rationale for what you did. If you do this interview, you may have to pick teams you're interested in beforehand so people from those teams can attend.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Datadog\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nFrom the first technical phone screen through to the onsite coding rounds, you should expect algorithmic questions but likely NOT questions taken verbatim from LeetCode – Datadog has their own internal question bank. We’ve heard that the questions are a hybrid between practical and LeetCode-style. They might start with something similar to what you can find on LeetCode but then layer on additional complexity. Datadog themselves recommend practicing medium-level LeetCode questions. You might be asked questions like these:\n\n*   Bucketing numbers given specific requirements\n*   Given a root directory, find the total size of all the files across all sub-directories\n*   Given an interface and a file class, build a buffered file writer\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Datadog interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Datadog engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Sets](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sets)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nWe’ve heard that this round is less broad than it can be at other companies. You won’t be asked to “Design Twitter”, for example. Instead, you might get a question such as, “Given a service that returns flight deals for the last 7 days, design a system that surfaces relevant flight data to a user and notifies the user when there’s a new flight that matches their criteria.”\n\nAs one of our users said:\n\n> _\"\\[I\\] didn’t have to go into detail in every area. They kept it very high level, and the interview felt fair.”_\n\nWhile it might be a fair interview, it’s also used for leveling so make sure to brush up on system design. We’ve heard of candidates being down-leveled for less-than-flawless performance here.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis interview will be with someone in a leadership role at the company, possibly a director. It will contain some standard behavioral questions but also some technical questions about your past work.\n\nYou might be asked to show a simple design of something you built at a previous company. The interviewer will want to know why certain design choices were made so they can understand your impact on the project and your level of experience working within teams.\n\n### How Datadog Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nAfter a successful onsite, a Hiring Committee will decide if you should be hired.\n\nIf they want to make an offer, your profile will be shared with multiple hiring managers for team matching. You’ll get a chance to meet a few people from the team including the hiring manager. This is more about you figuring out a good fit than being a continuation of the interview process.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Along with behavioral, it’s what determines your level, and the bar is high.\n\n![Recruiter call, Hiring Manager screen, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Door_Dash_Interview_Process_64864553b9.png)\n\nAt DoorDash, the process has recently moved from centralized to decentralized. This means that the interview process will vary from team to team somewhat. You apply and interview for a specific role, and the hiring manager for that role will be part of your loop. You can interview for up to 3 roles at a time and will encounter interviewers from across the organization in most scenarios.\n\nThe entire process takes about 3-4 weeks but can be completed in as little as 2 weeks, according to our sources.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nDoorDash’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in DoorDash, your understanding of DoorDash’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure your skill set matches the requirements. After this call, the recruiter will circulate your resume and specific hiring managers will have the opportunity to pick it up and request to interview you.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Hiring Manager Screen\n\nThis interview will be with the hiring manager for the team you applied to. They will ask you to do a deep dive into a previous project.\n\n### Step 3: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThis is a pretty standard technical screen and normally gets conducted in CodePair (HackerRank). Our sources tell us that LeetCode medium questions are pretty typical in this round.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nAt this point, candidates are split into different loops depending on the role they are interviewing for, e.g., infrastructure, frontend, backend etc. Onsite interview loops vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get:\n\n*   **Two coding rounds** (1 hour each). These rounds usually take place in CodePair (HackerRank). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/doordash-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at DoorDash\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nDoorDash has shifted its process from a centralized one to a decentralized one pretty recently, so there is some variation in terms of the style of question you will encounter. That said, the engineers we’ve spoken to say it’s still pretty standard fare across the board, so practicing medium-level LeetCode questions will help.\n\n### Coding\n\nThis interview will be less algorithms and data structures heavy and will look to test your ability to write code fast and refactor quickly. You won’t be asked to use any specific programming language. Most questions should be practical in nature, and LeetCode questions that focus on job scheduling are popular.\n\nFrom one of our users, who was a DoorDash interviewer:\n\n> _Some questions are very practical, but it depends on the interviewer. Some love very specific LeetCode-style graph questions._\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in DoorDash interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former DoorDash engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Trees](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Linked Lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 13  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis round focuses mostly on large systems and will involve designing an entire service or app with scalability, reliability, and usability concerns in mind. Expect a vague problem with ill-defined boundaries. Your focus should be on not getting lost in one area. Ask your interviewer what area you should hone in on.\n\nThey use this round for leveling, and senior candidates should be able to call out all requirements and considerations. They aren’t looking for a full solution here, so don’t get lost in the details. Cover all bases and concerns.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis round varies by role but is usually with the hiring manager for your team. It is a behavioral interview, but the hiring manager will also try to close you. You could pass all the other rounds and not do well here but still get an offer. Expect to answer questions about past experiences.\n\n### How DoorDash Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThe entire onsite panel submits written feedback after the interviews are completed, and then they have a roundtable meeting to discuss both hire/no-hire and leveling. Most of the time, decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn’t possible, the hiring manager has final say. Our sources say that it is rare for a hiring manager to veto a hire.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](https://interviewing.io/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\nFigma’s Interview Process & Questions\n=====================================\n\n_The info below is based on conversations with Figma engineers._\n\nPublished:\n\nFigma's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4-5 Steps\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Figma can expect the following process:\n\n*   Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n*   Hiring manager call (45 mins)\n*   Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n*   Onsite (4 hours)\n*   Additional “Executive Screen” for Staff-level engineers (1 hour)\n\nStaff-level engineers (or even Seniors on the cusp of Staff) can sometimes get an additional round after the onsite. This is an executive screen, which is essentially a behavioral interview with the director of the team you are interviewing for.\n\n![Figma’s interview process: Recruiter call, Hiring manager call, Technical phone screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Figma_s_Company_Process_df7aa4a2c0.png)\n\nFigma’s hiring process is a hybrid. Although you apply for a specific team from the get-go, your interviews will likely not be with the people on your team – interviewers are randomly selected from a pool – except for the hiring manager interview and the executive screening (if applicable).\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   You’ll get [a guide to Figma’s hiring process](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4tdq51dnc2ykp347vmphy/Public-General-Candidate-Prep-Doc.pdf?rlkey=mfucvg5hiava8x2xpuz24tiwh&e=4&dl=0)\n     that includes a lot of useful information\n*   Their interview process is language-agnostic\n*   Brush up on general algorithms and data structures, but be prepared for them to use Figma terminology when they pose the questions\n*   They say you can only apply to one role at a time, so pick wisely\n*   Try to get a referral; it’s hard to get into the process otherwise\n*   Learn as much as you can about Figma’s architecture\n*   Express why you like the product and why you want to join–they are on the path to IPO and getting a lot of high-quality applicants\n\nThe entire process takes about 3-4 weeks, but we heard they can move faster if needed.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nFigma’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Figma, your understanding of Figma’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Hiring Manager Call\n\nThis is a pretty standard behavioral call with the hiring manager of the team you are interviewing for. Expect some questions about your background and experience but also some information about the team and what they are working on. You’ll get time to ask your own questions too.\n\n### Step 3: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThis interview is scheduled as a block with the hiring manager call above and will be conducted in CoderPad. The questions will be algorithmic, but they will be set in a Figma context. In other words, they might pose a problem they run into at Figma and ask how you’d solve it with code, or ask you a very standard algorithmic question, but layer in some Figma terminology. It’s a good idea to brush up on Figma’s names for the various components they use. [You can find information here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma)\n. Expect about a medium in terms of LeetCode-level.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nAt this point, candidates split into different loops depending on the role they are interviewing for e.g., ML, frontend, backend etc. Onsite interview loops also vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get:\n\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in Figma. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Second system design** (1 hour) This interview will be conducted in Figma. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n*   **Project deep dive** (1 hour) For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Project Deep Dive section below](https://interviewing.io/figma-interview-questions#question-deep-dive)\n    .\n\n### \\[Staff-level or Close to It\\] Step 5: Executive Screen\n\nIf you’re interviewing for a Staff level role, or quite senior and on the cusp of Staff, they will do one more round after the onsite. It is a behavioral round with a Director. They might tell you this is a casual chat, but one engineer said:\n\n> _The Director clearly used all the feedback given during the onsite and intentionally drilled into areas that were outside of what I’d covered before. This was very intense!_\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Figma\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThis will likely be algorithms and data structures-focused but will skew more practical than typical LeetCode questions. Expect about a LeetCode-medium level of difficulty. An engineer we spoke called described them as\n\n> _Pretty standard algorithms and data structures questions, but they are all Figma-flavored._\n\nSample questions include:\n\n*   Implement a Figma doc with layers, properties, class definitions, and ways to update\n*   Print out objects on a 2D canvas in a sequential order, left to right and top to bottom\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Figma interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Figma engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nYou will get two system design rounds:\n\n1.  Relating to [Figma components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma)\n     and how to design a feature around them\n2.  Another that is more focused on your specific role\n\nThey will send you a public guide to Figma components to help with the first system design round, so brush up on that. Components are like classes in Figma. The second round will lean more towards the type of work you will be doing, e.g., back-end or front-end.\n\nAs with the coding interviews, expect something practical here. It will very likely be related to an issue that Figma has encountered before. You might be asked to design a poll system within Figma that can handle multiple concurrent users. Expect to be asked about scaling and storage options.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis interview will be conducted by a hiring manager from within the same organization but not the team you are interviewing for. It’s going to be pretty standard, with questions about:\n\n*   How you’ve handled feedback in the past\n*   How you approach conflict\n*   Past projects you’re proud of\n\n### Project Deep Dive\n\nFor this interview, you’ll be asked to prepare a few slides on a previous technical project you’ve worked on. It’s a pretty interactive session where they’ll dig into:\n\n*   The scale and scope of your role on the project\n*   The technical details of the project\n*   What issues you ran into\n*   What tradeoffs were made\n*   What you’d do differently\n\nUnlike some project deep dives we’ve come across, this will likely be with only one interviewer.\n\n### Executive Screen\n\nAll we can say is that this is a behavioral round. It’s hard to say what the Director will ask during this session, but they will be looking for any areas left unturned during the onsite and drilling into them.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

They will want you to know these and align with them during your interviews.\n*   It's a foreign-founded company, so you may encounter interviewers who aren’t native English speakers and have a different cultural style than you’re used to.\n\nGrammarly has a hybrid process, which means that you will interview for a specific team and role but your interview panel will be a mix of engineers from the team and from elsewhere in the company. It will also include the hiring manager for the role you are interviewing for.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6 weeks, but our sources tell us it shouldn’t have to – by default, Grammarly is slow in moving things forward, but if you’re proactive, you can speed up the process.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nGrammarly’s recruiter call lasts about 30 minutes, and it’s different from a lot of recruiter screens. Be prepared to get asked questions that require STAR-style responses. One of our sources was surprised by the style of question they got at this stage, so be prepared!\n\nIt’s also really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nGrammarly’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. It will be conducted in HackerRank, and you should expect medium-difficulty LeetCode-style questions.\n\n### Step 3: Hiring Manager Screen\n\nThis is a presentation and a deep dive into a complex project that you’ve worked on. For more senior roles, you’ll be asked to describe a project you led.\n\nWe’ve heard that you may not necessarily get clear instructions about this round, and you may not be told to prepare a presentation in advance, but we heartily recommend that you do! One of our sources did well in this round _because he already had a presentation prepared for another company and was able to seamlessly jump into it when he realized what the call was about_. Though it may not be critical to have a presentation fully prepared, doing so will give you an edge. Either way, come prepared to discuss the overall architecture (including diagrams as needed), what problem you were trying to solve, and your role in the successful completion of the project.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nWe’ve heard that Grammarly’s onsite is very long and can be split across multiple days.\n\n*   **Product intuition/domain expertise** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodePair (HackerRank’s coding interview tool). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This will likely be in Miro or HackerRank's whiteboarding tool. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Coding / CS fundamentals** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodePair. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Coffee chat (virtual)** (30 minutes). You meet with two people from your future team and get to ask them questions.\n*   **Values call 1** (1 hour) This interview will be with someone from Grammarly who isn’t from the org or team you are applying to. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Values section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-values)\n     .\n*   **Values call 2** (1 hour) This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Values section below](https://interviewing.io/grammarly-interview-questions#question-values)\n     .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Grammarly\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom what we’ve heard, Grammarly doesn’t ask practical questions. They do have a standard bank of questions they regularly ask, and LeetCode-style questions are common.\n\n### Product Intuition / Domain Expertise\n\nThis might be a two-part question and varies by role. In the first part, you could be shown an email with the Grammarly tool engaged and certain words or phrases highlighted. Your job will be to improve the product.\n\nThe second part will involve a standard LeetCode-style question.\n\n### Coding\n\nExpect another two-part interview here with standard LeetCode-style questions in the first part.\n\nThe second part might be a lot more academic. One source told us:\n\n> _\"The second problem looked like it came straight out of an algorithms textbook.”_\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Grammarly interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Grammarly engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Recursion](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=recursion)\n\n[Two Pointers](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=two-pointers)\n\n[Heaps](https://interviewing.io/heaps-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/heaps-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=heaps)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis will likely be a two-part question where you’re asked to design something at a small scale in the first part and then asked to scale it up in the second. Time management is critical here because they will ask lots of questions during the first part. We’ve heard that this is a tough interview, but that you can do poorly, and potentially get a chance to redo it after the onsite.\n\nAreas to focus on are:\n\n*   Client-server communication\n*   Separation of concerns\n*   Data structures and flows\n*   A system’s extensibility and scaling\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Values\n\nYou will have two calls that focus on Values, one with a hiring manager and the other with someone from a completely different part of the company. One of the people we interviewed for this guide was interviewed by someone from the Social Media team.\n\nBoth calls will ask questions about your past work experience. They will use your resume and frame their questions around your past companies. Be prepared to use their [EAGER framework](https://www.grammarly.com/about)\n of values, and show that you understand and embody the values they are looking for. EAGER stands for Ethical, Adaptable, Gritty, Empathetic, and Remarkable. Look for ways to show that you embody these values as you go through your interviews, even the technical ones.\n\nExpect to go through each company you’ve worked from and answer questions like:\n\n*   What would your manager say your strengths were?\n*   What would your manager say your weaknesses were?\n*   What would you say your manager's strengths were?\n*   What would you say your manager's weaknesses were?\n\n### How Grammarly Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThe entire onsite panel submits written feedback after the interviews are completed and then meets to discuss. Most of the time, decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn’t possible, the hiring manager has the final say.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

For more senior roles, you’ll be asked to describe a project you led.\n\nWe’ve heard that you may not necessarily get clear instructions about this round, and you may not be told to prepare a presentation in advance, but we heartily recommend that you do! One of our sources did well in this round _because he already had a presentation prepared for another company and was able to seamlessly jump into it when he realized what the call was about_. Though it may not be critical to have a presentation fully prepared, doing so will give you an edge. Either way, come prepared to discuss the overall architecture (including diagrams as needed), what problem you were trying to solve, and your role in the successful completion of the project.",

Although you apply for a specific team from the get-go, your interviews will likely not be with the people on your team – interviewers are randomly selected from a pool – except for the hiring manager interview.\n\nHubspot is one of the few companies that will actually give you some constructive post-interview feedback!\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   LeetCode practice is helpful, as their coding questions are all in that style.\n*   During the coding rounds, it is important to find edge cases.\n*   You might read that they are very focused on the behavioral round and your ability to match up to their values, but in practice we’ve heard their behavioral round is pretty standard. That said, the interviewers will talk about the culture so it’s best to come prepared with questions about their values.\n*   They use Java, but the interview process is language-agnostic.\n*   You must convince the interviewer you are familiar with the technologies you mention in a system design interview. You need to know more than buzzwords.\n*   They know that most of their questions are found online, so they look for you to go deeper.\n*   You’ll get detailed feedback from the recruiter after the technical onsite rounds. This can be given verbally or via email and will happen before the behavioral round.\n\nThe hiring process takes about 2-4 weeks, and we’ve heard that their interviewers are pretty friendly and collaborative compared to FAANG companies. They are also competitive with FAANG salaries.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nHubSpot’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in HubSpot, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They will discuss salary ranges, and we’ve heard they are competitive with Meta and Google.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Asynchronous Coding Challenge\n\nIn this challenge, you’ll get API access. You’ll need to make a call to the API, process data, and POST back a response/solution. If the solution is correct, you’ll get a 200 status code, which means you’ve completed the exercise.\n\nYou can use any language for this assignment, and it starts as soon as you click the link in the email they will send you. You have three hours to complete the assignment, i.e., make the request to the API. After that, you’ll need to submit the code in a zip file, but that doesn’t need to happen within the three hour window, so you’ll have time to clean up your code afterward.\n\nOne engineer we spoke to said:\n\n> _I don’t think they even review the code, you just need to get 200, and that’s good enough to pass._\n\nAnother engineer we spoke to described the problem as follows:\n\n> _Overall, the pattern is going to be a sorting/aggregating approach to a JSON array, where you have some field like “timestamp”, and some other field that might be an enum, and you will be posting it back to the API provided_\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly between Senior SWE 1 and Senior SWE 2 but only during the second system design round. **You have to pass each round before moving on to the next.**\n\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad, but we have heard you can use your own IDE too. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in the drawing tool of your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **System design 2 (depending on your level, details are different)** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/hubspot-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at HubSpot\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThis will be algorithms and data structures-focused, with LeetCode-style questions. We’ve heard they usually ask LeetCode easy to mediums. While the challenge might seem easy, HubSpot wants you to catch all the edge cases and run tests.\n\nCommunication and clarifying questions are things they are looking for. They know their questions can be found online. They expect you have already seen and solved them.\n\nSome examples of the question types they ask are:\n\n*   Most repeated substring of size k\n*   Find the matching string pattern in a given string.\n*   Find all commonly repeated strings in the 'engineering' string one.

You’ll be asked to design something like Netflix. The main difference between HubSpot and other companies is that they aren’t as obsessed with you mapping out the most optimized solution. It’s more about capturing a broad answer than going deep into one solution.\n\nYour second system design will depend on which role you are interviewing for.\n\n#### Senior SWE 1 (Equivalent to L4 at other companies)\n\nYou will usually be asked to design something like a weather service. One engineer we spoke to described it as being more like application design. The areas you need to consider are:\n\n*   Data storage\n*   Reliability\n*   Performance\n*   Horizontal scaling\n*   Trade-offs\n\nMake sure to ask clarifying questions before you do anything. Their interviewers are collaborative. If you bring up any technologies, you need to know them well as they will drill into them.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n#### Senior SWE 2 (Equivalent to L5 at other companies)\n\nThis system design round is split into two parts. First, you will be asked to write a document covering a past, technically challenging project and submit it for review They want you to list everything involved from start to finish, including:\n\n*   An overview of business problem\n*   The challenges faced\n*   The technical implementation\n*   Any design tradeoffs\n*   The rollout plan\n*   The chosen success metrics\n*   Any lessons learned\n\nThey will review your write-up, and, if they like it, you will be invited to another live interview where they will ask you questions about the project.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis interview will be conducted by the hiring manager of the team you are interviewing for. It’s going to be pretty standard, with situational questions. As above, they may talk about the culture at HubSpot so it’s a good idea to come prepared with questions that delve into their values.\n\n### How HubSpot Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nDecisions are reached based on your performance in each round. You can still get an offer with one “no-hire”, but your other rounds need to be very strong for this to happen. Hiring managers may still reject candidates in the team matching phase if they see one “no-hire”.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

If the solution is correct, you’ll get a 200 status code, which means you’ve completed the exercise.\n\nYou can use any language for this assignment, and it starts as soon as you click the link in the email they will send you. You have three hours to complete the assignment, i.e., make the request to the API. After that, you’ll need to submit the code in a zip file, but that doesn’t need to happen within the three hour window, so you’ll have time to clean up your code afterward.\n\nOne engineer we spoke to said:\n\n> _I don’t think they even review the code, you just need to get 200, and that’s good enough to pass._\n\nAnother engineer we spoke to described the problem as follows:\n\n> _Overall, the pattern is going to be a sorting/aggregating approach to a JSON array, where you have some field like “timestamp”, and some other field that might be an enum, and you will be posting it back to the API provided_",

You usually apply or get brought in for a generic job listing, and then they will determine which team you interview for. Your interviewers will come from all across the org, but the hiring manager for the role you are interviewing for will usually be involved from the start. You can only interview once, but if you don’t get an offer from the team you interviewed with, you may still have a chance with another team.\n\nThe entire process takes about 2-4 weeks.\n\nGeneral advice:\n\n*   Instacart doesn’t ask questions that require knowledge of academic or obscure data structures and algorithms. Although questions can still skew LeetCode-y, they won’t be questions that require knowledge of niche trees, dynamic programming, etc. Brush up on the basics, and you should be fine.\n*   Make sure you practice system design, as that interview is often make or break and is definitely used for leveling\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nInstacart’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you’re interested in Instacart. They’ll also talk about the specific role and team you’ve been matched with.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nInstacart’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. They use CodeSignal.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\n*   **Coding** (45 mins). Like the technical phone screen, this round will be conducted in CodeSignal, and you can use any language that CodeSignal supports. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Second coding**. As above.\n*   **System design** (45 mins). This section is really important and usually where people fail. You can use any tooling you’d like, e.g., Google Draw or Excalidraw. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Behavioral** (45 mins). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/instacart-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Instacart\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nA lot of Instacart’s questions are created in-house, but you may run into LeetCode-style questions as well.\n\n### Coding\n\nYou’ll be tested for pragmatic coding skills here. You might be asked to write a script to convert dollars to euros, get a question about API optimization, be asked about designing key-value stories, edit distance, expression evaluation, combinatorics, file I/O, or any number of other fairly practical questions.\n\nIn recent years, as Instacart has hired more FAANG alums, the question composition has shifted a bit to include more LeetCode-style questions. That said, even if you do get a LeetCode question, it will likely NOT touch on obscure algorithms or data structures.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Instacart interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Instacart engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Queues](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=queue)\n\n### System Design\n\nSystem design interviews at Instacart matter a lot for leveling. The most common failure mode we heard about was passing the coding portion and then failing on architecture.\n\nSpecifically, if you want to hit at least L6, you NEED to do well in this interview.\n\nThe engineers we spoke to said that in the system design portion, it’s really important to manage your time because there’s typically a lot you can cover with your answer, but they are looking for you to be concise. Also be prepared to justify your design decisions.\n\nYou might be asked to:\n\n*   Design a database model for an Instacart-like system\n*   Design a system for tracking shipments\n*   Design a system for communicating with a payment processor\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nInstacart’s behavioral interviews are pretty standard fare. You’ll be asked about past projects and your impact in previous roles. This interview is primarily used for leveling.\n\n### How Instacart Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nHiring decisions are made by rough consensus. There’s a debrief the same day or the day after your interview loop. People vote, but ultimately the decision rests with the hiring manager. From one of the engineers we spoke to:\n\n“_If there’s one strong no, that’s usually the end of it, and a strong yes from someone else probably wouldn’t countermand that._”\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Instacart?

They value collaboration as much as they do good code.\n*   Read Jane Street’s [blog post about their interview process](https://blog.janestreet.com/applying-to-jane-street/)\n    . Unlike most company pages, it’s detailed, useful, and good, and talks a lot about engineering interviews, specifically.\n*   Don’t try to impress them by coding in OCaml (their internal functional language of choice). Use the language you’re most comfortable in.\n\nThe entire process takes about 4 weeks.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nJane Street’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Jane Street, your understanding of Jane Street’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThis is a pretty standard technical round, with one LeetCode medium-style question that will have two parts. Your interviewer will be more interested in how you think and how you arrive at the solution than an optimal solution. Communicate your assumptions and discuss alternate approaches as you work your way through the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\n*   **3 coding / system design hybrid rounds** (75 mins each). These interviews will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding / System Design section](https://interviewing.io/jane-street-interview-questions#question-coding)\n     below.\n*   **Technical project deep dive** (75 mins). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Technical project deep dive section](https://interviewing.io/jane-street-interview-questions#question-project)\n     below.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Jane Street\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding / System Design\n\nWhereas the technical screen before the onsite is LeetCode-style and more academic, the coding rounds during the onsite are a little bit more practical. They also blend coding and system design so you might have to whiteboard out some pieces initially before jumping into code.\n\nYou will get a problem statement that is underspecified. Your job is to ask the right questions before you dive in and while you are working. Get comfortable building things from scratch. You might be asked to:\n\n*   Design Tetris\n*   Design a video player API\n\nYou’ll have to design it, code it out, and go deep into the logic.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Jane Street interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Jane Street engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Trees](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Maps](https://interviewing.io/maps-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/maps-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 2  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=maps)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Search](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Memoization](https://interviewing.io/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=memoization)\n\n### Technical Project Deep Dive\n\nYou will be asked to present an interesting, technically complex project that you’ve worked on, ideally something that you can talk about for an hour.

Its purpose is to check qualifications, hear about past projects, and find out what you’re looking for from LinkedIn and in general. It also acts as a culture fit check, so they’ll want to see how your communication and personality align with their values. Make sure you’re up to date on LinkedIn features, blog posts and news. Finally, your recruiter will make sure you understand the role you’re applying for and clarify next steps in the process.  \n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen lasts an hour, and interviews at this stage (and beyond) will usually have two interviewers, the primary interviewer and a trainee interviewer who’s shadowing.\n\nYou’ll be given 2-3 algorithms and data structures questions, structured as follows:\n\n*   If you’re applying for a niche role (e.g., mobile), you’ll get a 10-minute domain-specific question. This question is meant to quickly  gauge your expertise on your niche subject and screen out generalists.\n*   15-minute small problem\n*   30-minute medium problem\n\n### Step 3: Second Recruiter Call\n\nIf you pass the technical phone screen, a recruiter will reach out again for a 30 minute call. Having a second recruiter call in the middle of the process is unusual, but LinkedIn does it for a good reason: they have historically lost a lot of good candidates to FAANG, and so this call is their way of playing defense to get ahead of attrition. In this call, they’ll re-ask about whom you’re in process with and will try to make sure that they don’t lose you by moving too slowly.\n\nThough our advice about not revealing your hand stands, in this call, if you do have any tight timelines from other companies, it’s good to let them know because, according to our sources, they are indeed able to speed things up and move quickly.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nLinkedIn’s onsite usually lasts 5-6 hours and includes the following steps:\n\n*   Coding (1 hour)\n*   (For niche roles) Domain-specific coding (1 hour)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Technical communication (1 hour)\n*   Behavioral (1 hour)\n\nThe order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that LinkedIn’s interview process is centralized, you generally won’t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you’ll end up on.\n\n#### Coding\n\nThis interview will generally be one question or sometimes two, depending on how quickly you work through the first one.\n\n#### (For Niche Roles) Domain-Specific Coding\n\nIf you’re applying for a niche role (e.g., mobile), in addition to a general coding interview, you’ll have to do a domain-specific interview as well.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThe [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n will cover general system design knowledge and will focus on building large-scale systems. Make sure to communicate clearly and often during this interview and substantiate your design choices as well as your choices of specific technologies.\n\n#### Technical Communication\n\nThis interview will evaluate your ability to communicate and collaborate. You’ll be asked about one of your past projects and then walk your interviewer through it, with an emphasis on the technical aspects of your projects. Make sure you explain what the project was, why it mattered to the business, and what you did specifically. They’re expecting you to be able to dive really deep into the project you choose, so be ready to answer anything and everything about it.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThe behavioral interview at LinkedIn is very conversational. They’re looking to assess your culture fit and will ask you ad-hoc questions rather than preset or typical behavioral interview questions. Despite it being conversational in nature, it’s important to find ways to tie your answers to LinkedIn’s values:\n\n*   We put members first\n*   We trust and care about each other\n*   We are open, honest and constructive\n*   We act as One LinkedIn\n*   We embody diversity, inclusion and belonging\n*   We dream big, get things done and know how to have fun\n\n### Step 5: Team matching\n\nAssuming all has gone well to this point, you’ll be contacted by hiring managers for a team matching call. These calls are for the hiring managers to sell you on joining LinkedIn, and to create excitement about their specific orgs. It’s important to use this time to ask any questions you have about LinkedIn, the role or the process so far, and find out as much as possible about your team options.\n\nOnce you’re matched with a team they will extend you an offer. If you are far along in the process with other companies, make sure that you let them know that they should move quickly. This is another stage where LinkedIn loses a lot of candidates to FAANG, so they’re ready and able to speed things up.\n\nIn the event you’re unable to be matched with a team, your onsite results are valid with LinkedIn for 1 year, so they will continue trying to find a team for you.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at LinkedIn\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nLinkedIn has a company-wide question bank, though interviewers have a bit of wiggle room to change them up. We’ve heard from several sources that the question bank is fairly small (compared to other companies), and that the questions haven’t changed much over the past 7 years or more.\n\nTo figure out what specific types of questions to expect in your LinkedIn interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former LinkedIn interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### System Design\n\nTypical [system design](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n questions include:\n\n*   Design a system that will determine trending posts\n*   Design a system that will log requests\n*   Design a system that will show client feeds\n*   Design an API for some specific use case\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\nCommon LinkedIn Interview Questions\n-----------------------------------\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from LinkedIn ask on our platform.

If your aggregate score after the onsite is borderline, you may get asked to do another interview.\n\nCandidates who end up over the line get passed to the hiring committee, who make the final decision about both hiring and leveling.\n\nLinkedIn Interview Replays\n--------------------------\n\n[![Reverse word in string](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Linked_In_1_878141e885.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nLinkedIn Interviewer\\\n\\\nReverse word in string\\\n\\\nSpace Dragon, a LinkedIn engineer, interviewed Ice Gyro in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/linked-in-java-reverse-word-in-string)\n\n[![Matching pairs](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Linked_In_2_d36bb244fa.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nLinkedIn Interviewer\\\n\\\nMatching pairs\\\n\\\nAdmiral Velociraptor, a LinkedIn engineer, interviewed Dystopian Pizza in Python](https://interviewing.io/mocks/linked-in-python-matching-pairs)\n\n[![Falling leaves of a tree](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FGo_Linked_In_4_adbb4c4dcb.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nLinkedIn Interviewer\\\n\\\nFalling leaves of a tree\\\n\\\nExistential Crumpet, a LinkedIn engineer, interviewed Neuro Owl in Go](https://interviewing.io/mocks/linked-in-go-falling-leaves-of-a-tree)\n\n[![Two sum](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Script_Linked_In_6_2b87fe415b.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nLinkedIn Interviewer\\\n\\\nTwo sum\\\n\\\nExistential Crumpet, a LinkedIn engineer, interviewed Chaotic Pizza in JavaScript](https://interviewing.io/mocks/linked-in-javascript-two-sum)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at LinkedIn?

Its purpose is to check qualifications, hear about past projects, and find out what you’re looking for from LinkedIn and in general. It also acts as a culture fit check, so they’ll want to see how your communication and personality align with their values. Make sure you’re up to date on LinkedIn features, blog posts and news. Finally, your recruiter will make sure you understand the role you’re applying for and clarify next steps in the process.  \n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n.

Having a second recruiter call in the middle of the process is unusual, but LinkedIn does it for a good reason: they have historically lost a lot of good candidates to FAANG, and so this call is their way of playing defense to get ahead of attrition. In this call, they’ll re-ask about whom you’re in process with and will try to make sure that they don’t lose you by moving too slowly.\n\nThough our advice about not revealing your hand stands, in this call, if you do have any tight timelines from other companies, it’s good to let them know because, according to our sources, they are indeed able to speed things up and move quickly.",

          "content": "### Step 4: Onsite\n\nLinkedIn’s onsite usually lasts 5-6 hours and includes the following steps:\n\n*   Coding (1 hour)\n*   (For niche roles) Domain-specific coding (1 hour)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Technical communication (1 hour)\n*   Behavioral (1 hour)\n\nThe order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that LinkedIn’s interview process is centralized, you generally won’t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you’ll end up on.\n\n#### Coding\n\nThis interview will generally be one question or sometimes two, depending on how quickly you work through the first one.\n\n#### (For Niche Roles) Domain-Specific Coding\n\nIf you’re applying for a niche role (e.g., mobile), in addition to a general coding interview, you’ll have to do a domain-specific interview as well.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThe [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n will cover general system design knowledge and will focus on building large-scale systems. Make sure to communicate clearly and often during this interview and substantiate your design choices as well as your choices of specific technologies.\n\n#### Technical Communication\n\nThis interview will evaluate your ability to communicate and collaborate. You’ll be asked about one of your past projects and then walk your interviewer through it, with an emphasis on the technical aspects of your projects. Make sure you explain what the project was, why it mattered to the business, and what you did specifically. They’re expecting you to be able to dive really deep into the project you choose, so be ready to answer anything and everything about it.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThe behavioral interview at LinkedIn is very conversational. They’re looking to assess your culture fit and will ask you ad-hoc questions rather than preset or typical behavioral interview questions. Despite it being conversational in nature, it’s important to find ways to tie your answers to LinkedIn’s values:\n\n*   We put members first\n*   We trust and care about each other\n*   We are open, honest and constructive\n*   We act as One LinkedIn\n*   We embody diversity, inclusion and belonging\n*   We dream big, get things done and know how to have fun",

          "content": "### Step 5: Team matching\n\nAssuming all has gone well to this point, you’ll be contacted by hiring managers for a team matching call. These calls are for the hiring managers to sell you on joining LinkedIn, and to create excitement about their specific orgs. It’s important to use this time to ask any questions you have about LinkedIn, the role or the process so far, and find out as much as possible about your team options.\n\nOnce you’re matched with a team they will extend you an offer. If you are far along in the process with other companies, make sure that you let them know that they should move quickly. This is another stage where LinkedIn loses a lot of candidates to FAANG, so they’re ready and able to speed things up.\n\nIn the event you’re unable to be matched with a team, your onsite results are valid with LinkedIn for 1 year, so they will continue trying to find a team for you.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at LinkedIn\n--------------------------------------------------",

First, we spoke to some current and former LinkedIn interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.

Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](https://interviewing.io/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Interview Process & Questions\n==============================================\n\nPublished:\n\nMorgan Stanley's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 3 Steps\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Morgan Stanley can expect the following process:\n\n*   Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n*   Online assessment (only for some teams) (45 mins)\n*   Onsite (3-4 hours)\n\n![Morgan Stanley’s interview process: Recruiter call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Morgan_Stanley_s_Company_Process_e08eede811.png)\n\nMorgan Stanley has a decentralized hiring process. Each team interviews in its own style, and there are variations in the numbers and types of interviews you might encounter. A lot of it depends on the region you are interviewing in. You can apply to and interview for multiple roles simultaneously.\n\nYour interviewers will be selected from the team you are interviewing for by the hiring manager, based on their ability to assess you for specific skills, e.g., if the role requires you to be a Python expert, they will use another Python expert to interview you. The order of your interviews for the onsite portion is not predetermined, and the hiring manager will decide the schedule based on the availability of the interviewers deemed necessary.\n\nThe process can be quite slow, and they will not expedite things unless they feel like you are a perfect fit. Expect the process to last more than 6 weeks in most cases.\n\nGeneral advice:\n\n*   There is a big focus on collaboration, so don’t be combative in interviews.\n*   Communication is important for leveling. They want to know if you can communicate cross-functionally or potentially manage a team in the future.\n*   Practice the STAR method of answering behavioral interview questions.\n*   Just because you don’t get a job with one team doesn’t mean you’ve failed with Morgan Stanley as a whole. You don’t need to wait a year to apply to other teams, and you might find a more suitable role in the course of that same job search.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nMorgan Stanley’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you’re interested in Morgan Stanley. They’ll look for basic skill set alignment. They’ll also talk about the specific role and team you’ve been matched with.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Onsite\n\nAgain, this will vary in terms of interview types and order depending on the team you are interviewing with, but here is a sample schedule:\n\n*   **Asynchronous coding challenge** (45 mins). This challenge will be conducted in HackerRank. For some teams, this may happen before the onsite rather than as part of it. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Language-specific coding** (45 mins). Morgan Stanley is one of the few companies we’ve written about whose process isn’t always language agnostic. For some roles and teams, they may need you to know a specific language, and if that’s the case, they will do one round in that language where they’re specifically vetting you for familiarity with that language and its idiosyncrasies. This round is usually conducted in HackerRank. .\n*   **Data structures and algorithms** (45 mins). This round is usually conducted in HackerRank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Object-oriented programming** (45 mins). This will not be a coding interview. You’ll be asked a series of questions on the topic of object-oriented programming. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Object-Oriented Programming section below](https://interviewing.io/morgan-stanley-interview-questions#question-object-programming)\n    .\n*   **Behavioral** (45 mins) This is a team fit call with the hiring manager. Morgan Stanley’s behavioral interviews are pretty standard fare. You’ll be asked about past projects and your impact in previous roles.\n\nYou might notice the lack of a system design interview in the schedule above. This is typical for a lot of teams although you might interview for a team that includes one. If you do get a system design interview you might be asked product-focused system design questions.\n\nBe prepared for some repetition here. You should be ready to drive into your own product designs.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Morgan Stanley\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nManagers tend to come up with their own questions, but for core coding interviews, prepping on LeetCode will be very helpful. A lot of the teams will pull questions from there.\n\n### Coding\n\nAs above, you’ll run into a lot of LeetCode-style questions here. Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Morgan Stanley interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Morgan Stanley engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Inorder Traversal](https://interviewing.io/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 2  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=inorder-traversal)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Sliding Window](https://interviewing.io/sliding-window-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sliding-window-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sliding-window)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n[Two Pointers](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=two-pointers)\n\n### Object-Oriented Programming\n\nBelow are the types of questions you’ll likely be asked during this interview:\n\n*   Explain object-oriented programming. What is inheritance? What are the different types of inheritance?\n*   What is polymorphism?\n*   Give an example of operator overloading\n*   What is the difference between a struct and a class?\n*   What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?\n*   What is the difference between object-oriented programming and procedural programming?\n\n### How Morgan Stanley Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nDecisions are at the hiring manager's discretion. Some managers will make the decision themselves, and most will take feedback, but they do overrule negative feedback at times.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Morgan Stanley?

Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](https://interviewing.io/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\nNvidia’s Interview Process & Questions\n======================================\n\n_The info below is based on conversations with Nvidia engineers in 2024._\n\nPublished:\n\nNvidia's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 2-4 Steps\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Nvidia can expect the following process:\n\n*   \\[Can skip if referred in\\] Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n*   Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n*   \\[Not always\\] Hiring Manager call (30 minutes)\n*   Onsite (5 hours)\n\n![Nvidia’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Hiring manager call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nvidia_company_process_a84381e04f.png)\n\nNvidia has a decentralized process that varies based on the hiring manager's preference, e.g., some people we spoke with had no recruiter screen and some had no hiring manager call before the onsite. One candidate even had their hiring manager call first, before anything else happened! The onsite rounds can also change a lot. We will do our best to sketch out the process, but yours may differ depending on the role you are interviewing for. While there is some flexibility regarding what role you end up interviewing for, you don’t seem to be able to interview for multiple teams. All of your interviewers will be from the team you are interviewing for.\n\nOne engineer we spoke to, who interviewed with Nvidia for two separate teams told us:\n\n> _If you get an early hiring manager call, you can ask them exactly what to expect in the rest of the rounds. If they say the language is the priority, brush up on those skills, if they say it will be more general, then focus on general coding._\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   LeetCode practice will help, but they will throw in more practical questions too.\n*   They don’t have an internal question bank, so the interview questions are up to the individual interviewer.\n*   Nvidia puts a premium on experience and advanced academic degrees.\n*   A good (senior) referral can help you skip the recruiter call.\n*   Most roles they hire for are software-orientedsoftware oriented, not hardware as you might expect\n*   If you fail with one team, you can immediately interview with another one, but you will have to go through the whole process again, though it’s possible you’ll be able to skip the technical phone screen.\n*   They will always have at least one interview that is focused on the language you will need for whatever team you are joining.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6-8 weeks.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nNvidia’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you’re interested in Nvidia and do some basic skills assessment.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nYou might start with 15 minutes of general chat in this round but, the guts of the interview will be technical. In the general chat, you might be asked about your background and why you’re interested in Nvidia. The technical portion will be 45 minutes long. One engineer we spoke to was asked only LLM questions here and everything was done in PyTorch, but this is largely dependent on the role you are interviewing for. Nvidia is very focused on hiring engineers with LLM experience right now so, if that’s what you applied to, expect LLM questions rather than general CS skill questions. If not, expect a LeetCode medium-style question, but remember, they don’t have an internal bank from what we’ve heard, so you might get something more practical too.\n\nIf you are asked LLM questions, expect them to focus on concepts such as:\n\n*   Mixture-of-experts model\n*   Beam search\n*   Autoregressive decoding with KV-cache\n*   Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)\n*   High-level distributed computing\n\nFor example, you might be asked to implement beam search for LLM inference and evaluate the time complexity of each operation.\n\n### Step 3: Hiring Manager Call\n\nThis is usually split into two parts. You will be asked about your background and experience in the first part. The hiring manager will be testing for culture fit. In the second part, they will be selling you on the role and team.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nThis will vary by role but here’s what you can expect.\n\n*   **Coding x 2** (1 hour each). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Second Coding** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding (domain-specific) section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-domain)\n    .\n*   **Hiring Manager** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Hiring Manager interview section below](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#question-manager)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Nvidia\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nOk, things can vary quite a bit here, as with everything in the Nvidia hiring process! One engineer we spoke to had 2 low-level coding rounds that were very practical and domain-aligned for the team he interviewed with. Others got more standard LeetCode-style questions during these two rounds.\n\nWe also heard that there are different formats for the coding rounds for certain teams. You might get a problem to solve in some and have to review existing code in others, similar to a debugging round.\n\nIf the role you have applied to will rely heavily on Cuda, expect to be interviewed in C++. Every role at Nvidia is a bit different though so lot’s of languages are used. It should be clear from the job description if there is a specific language required. If not, ask the hiring manager in advance so you are prepared!\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Nvidia interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Nvidia engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.\n\nFirst, here’s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to Nvidia:\n\n*   C++ Fundamentals\n*   LLMs\n    *   See the [technical phone screen section above](https://interviewing.io/nvidia-interview-questions#step-2)\n         for examples of LLM sub-topics\n\nAnd here are technical topics that you’re likely to find at other companies as well (for these we’ve created detailed write-ups of their own):\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Inorder Traversal](https://interviewing.io/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/inorder-traversal-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 2  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=inorder-traversal)\n\n[Linked Lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 13  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### Coding (Domain-Specific)\n\nThis will be a more practical round. You might be asked to reimplement an algorithm from first principles. You might get a mix of technical questions and actual coding to do. Whatever you get will be specific to the role you are interviewing for.\n\n### System Design\n\nThis will more than likely be a pretty standard system design round but, again, things vary from team to team. Brush up on the usual questions like “How would you design Twitter / Uber / a chatbot for a website,” BUT they may ask you something more practical for the role. Learn about CPU/GPU architecture and anything else relevant to the team you are interviewing for!\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Hiring Manager Interview\n\nThis will be more conversational than the other rounds but could have behavioral/experience-based questions, as well as technical questions depending on the hiring manager.\n\n### How Nvidia Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nAfter the onsite, the panel all submit a scorecard. You don’t need to score perfectly (it’s from 1-5) on each scorecard, but it’s unlikely to be hired if you’ve scored poorly on even one round.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Nvidia?

Take the tips seriously!\n*   The coding questions you’ll get are more practical than LeetCode. They are algorithms and data structures questions, but they are actual things that you might do at work.\n*   Prepare slides for the presentation part of the onsite (even though it’s not required).\n*   Be prepared to discuss ethics and safety in AI. Read their blog!\n\nThe hiring process at OpenAI is decentralized, with a lot of variation in interview steps and styles depending on the role and team you are interviewing for. You will get some sort of technical assessment before the onsite, and it can be anything from a technical phone screen, an asynchronous assessment, or a take-home project. It may even be two separate steps. We’ve heard they use HackerRank for asynchronous coding tests but CoderPad for live interviews. This guide will assume that there will be two live technical phone screens, but your mileage may vary depending on team and role – check out [OpenAI’s own interview guide](https://openai.com/interview-guide)\n for more info.\n\n![OpenAI’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, 2nd Technical Screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Open_AI_interview_process_cd24f67a14.png)\n\nAt OpenAI, there is some flexibility in terms of which role and team you might end up on – you might apply to one role but have them suggest others as you move through the process. Your interviewers will probably come from multiple different teams. Prepare for it to feel chaotic.\n\nFrom one of our users who recently interviewed with Open AI:\n\n> _“Everything they did made them seem wildly disorganized. They didn’t stay in touch through the process. A lot of radio silence.\"_\n\nThe entire process can take 6-8 weeks, but if you put pressure on them throughout you can speed things up, especially if you mention that you have other offers.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nOpenAI’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in OpenAI, your understanding of OpenAI’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward.\n\nIn this round, your recruiter will also tell you what to expect in the next round, given how much variability there is in the interview process for different roles and teams. Your recruiter will also be in touch throughout the interview process to prep you for what’s coming up next.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nOpenAI’s first technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in CoderPad. This is an algorithms and data structures style interview, but the questions are more practical than questions you’d find on LeetCode. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [“Types of Interview Questions to Expect at OpenAI”](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-types)\n below.\n\n### Step 3: Second Technical Phone Screen or Assessment\n\nThe format of this round varies by role and will be more domain-specific than the previous round. For instance, you may get an asynchronous exercise or a take-home assignment. Or you may have to do another technical phone screen.\n\nWe expect that for many of our readers, who tend to be senior, back-end focused engineers, this round will be an architecture interview. See the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-design)\n below for more details on question types.\n\n_If you have more information about this part of the process or see anything that’s incorrect, please fill in [our form](https://iiosurveys.typeform.com/to/LXqccdMk)\n_\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nOnsite interview loops also vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get:\n\n*   **Behavioral interview with a senior manager** (45 mins) This is a phone call with a hiring manager, typically someone quite senior at the company. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n     below.\n*   **Presentation** (45 mins) You’ll be asked to prepare this in advance. For more detail, see the [Presentation section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-presentation)\n     below.\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in your own IDE with screen-share or in CoderPad. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-coding)\n     below.\n*   **System design** (1 hour). You'll use Excalidraw for this round. For more detail about what kind of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-design)\n     below.\n*   **Behavioral interview focused on working with teams** (30 mins). This and the hiring manager screen above are both behavioral. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/openai-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n     below.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at OpenAI\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAll of OpenAI’s interview questions have a degree of practicality and are usually language agnostic.\n\n### Coding\n\nOpenAI’s onsite coding interviews will be more practical than many companies’. Although you will still get algorithmic questions, they are going to be about stuff you might actually do at work.\n\n> _“You’re not going to get questions on string manipulation.”_\n\nIn these interviews, they are looking for your ability to write code that is going to be fast enough now but flexible enough to scale and adapt in the future.\n\nYou can choose the language for the coding rounds, and the questions are picked based on whichever language you choose.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in OpenAI interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former OpenAI engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\nFirst, here’s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to OpenAI:\n\n*   Time-based data structures\n*   Versioned data stores\n*   Coroutines in your chosen language (multithreading, concurrency, etc.)\n*   object-oriented programming concepts (abstract classes, iterator classes, inheritance, etc.)\n\nAnd here are technical topics that you’re likely to find at other companies as well (for these we’ve created detailed write-ups of their own):\n\n[Trees](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=depth-first-search)\n\n[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=breadth-first-search)\n\n[Recursion](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=recursion)\n\n### System Design\n\nYou may get two system design rounds during the interview loop, one before the onsite and one during.\n\nIf you get one before the onsite, expect something practical – you might be asked to design Yelp, Foursquare, Twitter, or a notifications system.\n\nIn this round, they probe for depth of knowledge and will ask a bunch of follow-up questions. It’s also best not to name-drop names of tools:\n\n> _“If you call out any specific technologies during this round, be prepared to go into detail about them! It may be best not to bring up specific examples as they seem to like drilling into the pros and cons of your choice.”_\n\nAlthough a more domain-specific interview may pop up for some roles, most engineers will get another system design round during the onsite. You will likely be prepped well for the topic of this interview, so pay attention to any tips they give you beforehand. If you got a system design round before the onsite, the style of question that you get in the onsite round will be very similar, though they may ask you to get into more detail.\n\nWe have heard that OpenAI might ask you to code in this interview. One user told us that they designed a solution to the problem that was posed to them but were then asked to code up a new solution using a different method.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Presentation\n\nYou’ll be asked to present a project you worked on to a senior manager. You won’t specifically be asked to prepare slides, but it’s a very good idea to do so. Be prepared to discuss the technical and business aspects and impact of the project, as well as your level of contribution, what tradeoffs were made, what other team members were involved, and what everyone’s responsibilities were. You may get some behavioral questions about how you worked with the team.\n\n### Behavioral\n\n#### Senior Manager Call\n\nThis is often with someone pretty high up at OpenAI. Our sources tell us it can be an interesting call. Although a lot of the questions will be standard, you may also be asked to delve deeper into something on your resume that catches the eye.\n\nFrom one source who interviewed with OpenAI recently:\n\n> _\"This interview was with John Rizzo, who is a well-known employee at OpenAI. It wasn’t an intense call, and John asked me some great questions about my background. It felt like he might have had veto power, but I enjoyed the call.\"_\n\nIt’s also a good idea to read OpenAI’s blog, particularly any articles that discuss ethics and safety in AI. They want to know that you’ve thought about the topic, so prepare yourself!\n\n#### Working with Teams\n\nThis is another type of behavioral interview you might encounter. Expect questions about times:\n\n*   You had to work cross-functionally across teams\n*   You’ve experienced conflict between teams or roles\n*   You’ve had competing ideas to move a project forward within your own team.\n\nAll of these questions are meant to get at your ability to work collaboratively.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Your recruiter will also be in touch throughout the interview process to prep you for what’s coming up next.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies.

Although you will still get algorithmic questions, they are going to be about stuff you might actually do at work.\n\n> _“You’re not going to get questions on string manipulation.”_\n\nIn these interviews, they are looking for your ability to write code that is going to be fast enough now but flexible enough to scale and adapt in the future.\n\nYou can choose the language for the coding rounds, and the questions are picked based on whichever language you choose.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in OpenAI interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former OpenAI engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\nFirst, here’s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to OpenAI:\n\n*   Time-based data structures\n*   Versioned data stores\n*   Coroutines in your chosen language (multithreading, concurrency, etc.)\n*   object-oriented programming concepts (abstract classes, iterator classes, inheritance, etc.)\n\nAnd here are technical topics that you’re likely to find at other companies as well (for these we’ve created detailed write-ups of their own):\n\n[Trees](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=depth-first-search)\n\n[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=breadth-first-search)\n\n[Recursion](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=recursion)",

It’s also best not to name-drop names of tools:\n\n> _“If you call out any specific technologies during this round, be prepared to go into detail about them! It may be best not to bring up specific examples as they seem to like drilling into the pros and cons of your choice.”_\n\nAlthough a more domain-specific interview may pop up for some roles, most engineers will get another system design round during the onsite. You will likely be prepped well for the topic of this interview, so pay attention to any tips they give you beforehand. If you got a system design round before the onsite, the style of question that you get in the onsite round will be very similar, though they may ask you to get into more detail.\n\nWe have heard that OpenAI might ask you to code in this interview. One user told us that they designed a solution to the problem that was posed to them but were then asked to code up a new solution using a different method.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.",

Although a lot of the questions will be standard, you may also be asked to delve deeper into something on your resume that catches the eye.\n\nFrom one source who interviewed with OpenAI recently:\n\n> _\"This interview was with John Rizzo, who is a well-known employee at OpenAI. It wasn’t an intense call, and John asked me some great questions about my background. It felt like he might have had veto power, but I enjoyed the call.\"_\n\nIt’s also a good idea to read OpenAI’s blog, particularly any articles that discuss ethics and safety in AI. They want to know that you’ve thought about the topic, so prepare yourself!\n\n#### Working with Teams\n\nThis is another type of behavioral interview you might encounter. Expect questions about times:\n\n*   You had to work cross-functionally across teams\n*   You’ve experienced conflict between teams or roles\n*   You’ve had competing ideas to move a project forward within your own team.\n\nAll of these questions are meant to get at your ability to work collaboratively.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Behavioral questions will be asked in every interview. Come prepared!\n*   Palantir believes in protecting civil liberties and rights. They look for people who are comfortable discussing these topics.\n*   It’s a mix of standard LeetCode-style questions and very non-standard questions. LeetCode prep isn’t going to be enough here.\n\n![Palantir’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Onsite, Hiring manager interview](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Palantir_interview_process_af7ed42bbf.png)\n\nAt Palantir, you apply for a catch-all backend or full stack role and team matching will happen later in the process. The process doesn’t vary much between roles although there are some variations for different levels of seniority. The recruiter might adjust the track you are on very slightly through the process but you’re more likely to do team matching after the onsite.\n\nThe entire process takes and 3-4 weeks but it’s possible to expedite things, especially with other offers in hand.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nPalantir’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s an important step. They filter out more candidates than most companies do at this stage from what we hear. They are looking for your motivations to join the company, so come to this call prepared to discuss why you want to be there in detail. It helps to have a compelling story as to what drew you to Palantir. You might get asked about your favorite, and least favorite past projects, as well as what you want to work on moving forward. They look for any red flags indicating you won’t be there long-term. An engineer who knows their process very well says:\n\n> _“Surface-level motivations to join the company won’t get you far and they will reject strong technical candidates if they don’t seem like a good cultural fit!”_\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nPalantir’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and happens in CodePair. This interview will feature algorithms and data structures but, the difference is that it won’t be purely technical and the algorithm you are solving will be put in the context of something you are building for an end-user. You’ll get asked to solve a problem in one half of the interview and behavioral questions in the other half. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [“Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Palantir” below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-types)\n.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nPalantir has 4 types of interviews they give most engineers during the onsite loop. **You will only get 3 of the 4, but we will describe each here.**\n\nEvery onsite interview will have 20 minutes of behavioral questions!\n\n*   **Problem decomposition** (1 hour). This is one of the options that you will almost definitely get. It’s really important and non-standard. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Problem decomposition section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-problem-decomposition)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This will be conducted in CodePair using the whiteboard functionality. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Re-engineering** (1 hour). You’ll be given a piece of code in CodePair and asked to review it for bugs. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Re-engineering section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-reengineering)\n    .\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This will be similar to the technical screen before the onsite, and is conducted in CodePair. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n\n### Step 4: Hiring Manager Interview\n\nThis interview will be a repeat of one of the onsite interviews. They look for red flags during the onsite and like to revisit any area they felt wasn’t up to scratch. It might not even be the technical piece they want to review! Again, the behavioral questions are very important.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Palantir\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWe can’t stress enough how embedded behavioral questions are at Palantir. As there is no behavioral interview during the onsite, they like to assess your motivations, cultural fit, and ability to work collaboratively all through the process. Come prepared with STAR-style answers, stories about why you want to work for Palantir, and ways you’ve thought about the end-user experience in other roles. If you propose a solution, talk about how it could be improved or modified for the users' benefit. You will also be asked about what projects you’ve enjoyed and not enjoyed. They want to know you’re OK working on all sorts of projects, not just glamorous ones.\n\n### Coding\n\nThe coding problems posed before are during the onsite will reflect the type of work you will be doing at Palantir, i.e., building products for end-users. So, while the core technical question might look like a standard LeetCode-style problem, it will be put in the context of a larger solution for an end-user. You’ll have to solve the problem but also consider and discuss its impact on the whole system, and how it will be used by the user. You’ll need to ask a lot of clarifying questions as it will be under-defined at first. Just keep thinking about the end-user and what trade-offs you will have to make in order to make the user experience positive. Maybe your solution is memory intensive, or maybe it's more runtime complexity intensive - think about and discuss improvements you could make to help the user in future iterations. They value user-centric thinking and empathy in finding solutions over algorithmic complexity. Think about how the user will use the code and how it could be improved, e.g., maybe you could implement caching so the user has a better experience each time they use the solution.\n\nA user who is very familiar with the Palantir interview process had this to say:\n\n> _“What strategies do you consider for enhancing performance beyond just the code you’re currently working on? Consider aspects such as caching and pre-computation to improve efficiency. Initially, your solution may not be the fastest, but implementing these strategies could significantly speed up subsequent operations._\n> \n> _\"Expect the problem to be intentionally vague. It’s important to anticipate and address any ambiguous scenarios, demonstrate caution regarding potential issues, and safeguard the system from malicious users.”_\n\nRegardless of what question you get, they’ll ask about decision-making, time and space complexity, etc. They want to know why you would approach a problem in a certain way, and they look for things that might cause issues with client integrations, etc.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Palantir interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Palantir engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Search](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Sets](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sets)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Queues](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=queue)\n\n### System Design\n\nAgain, this will be an industry standard round bar the added behavioral aspects. Our [system design guide](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n has been called “excellent preparation” by someone very familiar with Palantir’s interview.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Re-engineering\n\nIn this interview, you will be given a bunch of code in CodePair and asked to review it for bugs. You’ll be told how the system is supposed to work and that the output is wrong when you run the code. It will be about 500-100 lines of code, and it’s really important not to get lost in the first issue you see. Review everything from top to bottom as they will probably put in red herrings to distract you!\n\n### Problem Decomposition\n\nThis is probably the most important technical round you will face. It’s a non-standard interview where you will be asked to solve a high-level, real-world technical problem, with a real focus on thinking about the end-user. You won’t have to write code outside of maybe some pseudocode.\n\nThe problem might be something like:\n\n_\"How would you design a technology to help elderly people with poor vision who want to cook for themselves?\"_\n\nIt will be focused on an individual or an organization. Your goal is to come up with how to use technology to solve this problem. A lot of the focus here is on breaking the problem down into its component parts so you can tackle it. You’ll need to think about the time your solution will take, as well as how the respective parts of the solution might be built by different teams.\n\nThere will be two parts:\n\n*   Ideation: Break the problem down into its respective pieces and propose a solution to each. Agree on the solution with your interviewer.\n*   Execution: How you would design the solution at a high-level. This is more like system design. You won’t need to go too deep technically, e.g., you won’t need to provide detail on the type of database you would use, but you might discuss the type of data / schema you’d need to solve the problem.\n\nThe important thing here is, as with other rounds, to focus on the end-user. Think about how your solution would be used. Discuss ways to make it better. You’re being asked to display both your ability to problem-solve and your ability to empathize with users/clients.\n\n### Hiring Manager Interview\n\nAfter the onsite, the interview panel meets with a hiring manager to discuss your performance. If you pass, they’ll match you with a team that needs your skillset. From there, you’ll interview again with the hiring manager for that team.

They filter out more candidates than most companies do at this stage from what we hear. They are looking for your motivations to join the company, so come to this call prepared to discuss why you want to be there in detail. It helps to have a compelling story as to what drew you to Palantir. You might get asked about your favorite, and least favorite past projects, as well as what you want to work on moving forward. They look for any red flags indicating you won’t be there long-term. An engineer who knows their process very well says:\n\n> _“Surface-level motivations to join the company won’t get you far and they will reject strong technical candidates if they don’t seem like a good cultural fit!”_\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.",

This interview will feature algorithms and data structures but, the difference is that it won’t be purely technical and the algorithm you are solving will be put in the context of something you are building for an end-user. You’ll get asked to solve a problem in one half of the interview and behavioral questions in the other half.

This is one of the options that you will almost definitely get. It’s really important and non-standard. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Problem decomposition section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-problem-decomposition)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour).

For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Re-engineering** (1 hour).

For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Re-engineering section below](https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions#question-reengineering)\n    .\n*   **Coding** (1 hour).

Again, the behavioral questions are very important.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Palantir\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWe can’t stress enough how embedded behavioral questions are at Palantir. As there is no behavioral interview during the onsite, they like to assess your motivations, cultural fit, and ability to work collaboratively all through the process. Come prepared with STAR-style answers, stories about why you want to work for Palantir, and ways you’ve thought about the end-user experience in other roles. If you propose a solution, talk about how it could be improved or modified for the users' benefit. You will also be asked about what projects you’ve enjoyed and not enjoyed. They want to know you’re OK working on all sorts of projects, not just glamorous ones.",

          "content": "### Coding\n\nThe coding problems posed before are during the onsite will reflect the type of work you will be doing at Palantir, i.e., building products for end-users. So, while the core technical question might look like a standard LeetCode-style problem, it will be put in the context of a larger solution for an end-user. You’ll have to solve the problem but also consider and discuss its impact on the whole system, and how it will be used by the user. You’ll need to ask a lot of clarifying questions as it will be under-defined at first. Just keep thinking about the end-user and what trade-offs you will have to make in order to make the user experience positive. Maybe your solution is memory intensive, or maybe it's more runtime complexity intensive - think about and discuss improvements you could make to help the user in future iterations. They value user-centric thinking and empathy in finding solutions over algorithmic complexity. Think about how the user will use the code and how it could be improved, e.g., maybe you could implement caching so the user has a better experience each time they use the solution.\n\nA user who is very familiar with the Palantir interview process had this to say:\n\n> _“What strategies do you consider for enhancing performance beyond just the code you’re currently working on? Consider aspects such as caching and pre-computation to improve efficiency. Initially, your solution may not be the fastest, but implementing these strategies could significantly speed up subsequent operations._\n> \n> _\"Expect the problem to be intentionally vague. It’s important to anticipate and address any ambiguous scenarios, demonstrate caution regarding potential issues, and safeguard the system from malicious users.”_\n\nRegardless of what question you get, they’ll ask about decision-making, time and space complexity, etc. They want to know why you would approach a problem in a certain way, and they look for things that might cause issues with client integrations, etc.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Palantir interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Palantir engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Search](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Sets](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sets)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Queues](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=queue)",

          "content": "### Problem Decomposition\n\nThis is probably the most important technical round you will face. It’s a non-standard interview where you will be asked to solve a high-level, real-world technical problem, with a real focus on thinking about the end-user. You won’t have to write code outside of maybe some pseudocode.\n\nThe problem might be something like:\n\n_\"How would you design a technology to help elderly people with poor vision who want to cook for themselves?\"_\n\nIt will be focused on an individual or an organization. Your goal is to come up with how to use technology to solve this problem. A lot of the focus here is on breaking the problem down into its component parts so you can tackle it. You’ll need to think about the time your solution will take, as well as how the respective parts of the solution might be built by different teams.\n\nThere will be two parts:\n\n*   Ideation: Break the problem down into its respective pieces and propose a solution to each. Agree on the solution with your interviewer.\n*   Execution: How you would design the solution at a high-level. This is more like system design. You won’t need to go too deep technically, e.g., you won’t need to provide detail on the type of database you would use, but you might discuss the type of data / schema you’d need to solve the problem.\n\nThe important thing here is, as with other rounds, to focus on the end-user. Think about how your solution would be used. Discuss ways to make it better. You’re being asked to display both your ability to problem-solve and your ability to empathize with users/clients.",

Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](https://interviewing.io/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\nRippling’s Interview Process & Questions\n========================================\n\n_The info below is based on conversations with Rippling engineers._\n\nPublished:\n\nRippling's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Rippling can expect the following process:\n\n*   Recruiter call (15-30 minutes)\n*   Technical phone screen (1 hour)\n*   Hiring manager screen (1 hour)\n*   Onsite (3-4 hours)\n\nGeneral Tips:\n\n*   Rippling places a big emphasis on testing and running code during interviews\n*   Grinding on LeetCode medium and hard questions will help - you will need to move fast!\n*   System design round is used for leveling\n\n![Rippling’s interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Hiring manager screen, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Rippling_Company_Process_78740d50a1.png)\n\nRippling has a decentralized hiring process, which means that you interview for a specific role and will most likely be interviewed by people from that team, including a hiring manager. They seem to have recently moved to a decentralized process from a centralized one.\n\nThe entire process takes about 4-6 weeks but can be completed in as little as two weeks. Getting a referral might help you skip certain steps like online assessments and initial recruiter screens, but this seems to vary by team.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nRippling’s recruiter call lasts up to 30 minutes, and, if you’ve gotten referred in, it isn’t an assessment. The recruiter will introduce you to the company and walk you through the interview process. Without a referral, you may get some light behavioral questions.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nRippling’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour and is conducted in CodePair. It will feature LeetCode-style questions. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called [“Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Rippling” below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-types)\n.\n\n### Step 3: Hiring Manager Screen\n\nThis round can vary depending on team and location. Some hiring managers will use this round to discuss team fit, your background, and the scale and scope of projects you’ve worked on in a general sense.\n\nWe’ve heard that other hiring managers will ask you to present a project you’ve worked on and answer questions about it. You will know in advance. If you have to present a project, it’s wise to create slides. You will be asked about workflows and processes, what you were responsible for, what you learned, and what you might do differently. Either way, you will have time to ask questions, so come prepared.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\n*   **Coding** (90 mins). This interview will be conducted in either your own IDE with screen-share or in CodePair. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). Different teams at Rippling use different tooling here. We’ve even heard of one team asking for sketches to be done on paper! For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This round will be in CodePair. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/rippling-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Rippling\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nRippling does ask LeetCode-style questions. Most will be LeetCode medium-level, but we have heard of some harder questions being asked.\n\n### Coding\n\nThere are two coding interviews during the onsite.\n\n**The 90-minute coding interview** will have two parts. In the first one, you will be asked to build something. In the second, you will discuss what you built, what you could have done differently, how you would scale it, etc. This interview will be fairly practical. You might be asked to prepare a simple HTTP server and then write some simple REST APIs.\n\n**The 1-hour coding interview** will be LeetCode-style, but the questions will build on each other. You might be asked to design a data structure where you can get objects, insert objects, and get the average of all the objects in the data structure in a given time.\n\nFrom one of our users:\n\n> _“You’ll need to get comfortable with LeetCode medium and hard questions – you won’t have time to figure it out on the day. You need to work at a Meta-like pace.”_\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Rippling interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Rippling engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Trees](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Recursion](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=recursion)\n\n### System Design\n\nYou shouldn’t encounter anything too unusual here. You might be asked to design a news recommendation engine, a shopping recommendation engine, or a file-sharing system. The key here is to recognize the tradeoffs between approaches early and articulate them. Do move fast though, as they’ll ask a lot of questions about scaling.

Moreover, the people interviewing you won’t necessarily be from your future team (and likely won’t be).\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis step doesn’t happen 100% of the time. It depends on whether Robinhood recruiters reached out to you or whether you applied. If you applied, you do the recruiter call, and it’s standard stuff. They’ll discuss the role, expectations, your previous work history and Robinhood itself.\n\nIt’s really important at this stage not to reveal your salary expectations, salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nRobinhood's technical phone screen combines algorithms/data structures and system design, conducted through Karat. If you haven’t interviewed at a company that uses Karat before, it’s basically interviewer-as-a-service – companies pay them to conduct interviews on their behalf. This means that the person you’ll be talking to isn’t a Robinhood employee and won’t be able to answer questions about the team, roadmap, projects, etc. Their only objective is to screen you.\n\nThere are 30 minutes for each section, the coding portion will often feature one or two medium difficulty questions, whereas the system design will focus on general knowledge in a trivia-like format.\n\n### Step 3: Second Recruiter Call\n\nThe second recruiter call is meant primarily to prep you for the onsite, especially if you didn’t do the first call.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nThe onsite at Robinhood consists of 5 interview rounds with the following steps:\n\n*   Coding (1 hour)\n*   System design (2 hour)\n*   Past project review (1 hour)\n*   Hiring manager call (1 hour)\n\n#### Coding\n\nThis is an algorithms and data structures interview. Robinhood places an emphasis on correctness over scalability. These interviews typically happen in CoderPad.\n\n#### System Design\n\nTypically, the onsite interviews include two [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n rounds, each covering different aspects. One interview assesses your familiarity with a wide range of system design concepts, emphasizing high-level and well-rounded solutions. The other interview will delve into a specific facet of system design, challenging you to problem-solve in a more targeted area (e.g. front-end system design).\n\n#### Past Project Review\n\nThe past project round will evaluate your ability to communicate about technical topics. You’ll be asked to prepare something ahead of time based on a prompt. Be ready to discuss what you bring in depth. An example prompt is: Prepare a system diagram of a previous project.\n\n#### Hiring Manager Call\n\nRobinhood’s hiring manager call is a standard assessment of behavioral and cultural fit. The discussions are centered around role-related scenarios, with the aim of gauging problem solving and communication abilities.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Robinhood\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nRobinhood has a question bank with company-specific versions of common questions, but it’s not mandatory for interviewers to use, so there will often be a mix of those and other standard medium difficulty coding problems.\n\nTo figure out what specific types of questions to expect in Robinhood interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Robinhood interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.

Interview prep doesn't have to be.\n\n![Video Preview](https://interviewing.io/static/images/cyber-corgi/artboard.svg)\n\nGet instant access to anonymous mock interviews, salary negotiation, and the world's largest library of interview replays.\n\n[Get started](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\nRoblox’s Interview Process & Questions\n======================================\n\n_The info below is based on conversations with Roblox engineers._\n\nPublished:\n\nRoblox's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 4 Steps\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Roblox can expect the following hiring process:\n\n*   Recruiter call (30 minutes)\n*   Technical phone screen (60-90 mins)\n*   Onsite (4-7 hours)\n*   Bar raiser interview (1 hour)\n\nAt Roblox, the process is decentralized, with a lot of variation in interview steps depending on the role and seniority you are interviewing for. You interview for one specific role, and most of your interviewers, with one exception, will come from the same team.\n\nThe stages in the process vary depending on the seniority and role you are interviewing for, with managers having a lot of scope to customize the process for their open roles.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   Referrals will help you get a recruiter call.\n*   They look for a good match between a candidate’s skills and the role, so make sure your resume matches the job description you apply to.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6-8 weeks. By default, they tend to schedule interviews quite far apart compared to other companies, but if you push you can sometimes move things along.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nIf you get a recruiter call, it’s a great sign that they are genuinely interested. Recruiters will often send resumes to hiring managers before they even take a call so you’ve done well to get this far already. The recruiter call itself lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Roblox, and what you’re looking for moving forward.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThere is some variation in the type of screen you might get here, with more senior roles sometimes getting a system design interview. Most mid to senior-level backend and full stack engineers will get a coding round. It will be conducted in CodeSignal. We will cover the types of questions you can get here in the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-coding)\n below.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nSometimes you’ll get a recruiter prep call before the onsite. You can split the onsite interviews and complete them over a week or two. The mix of interviews can vary by team, and the more senior you are, the more rounds you can get, but this is what most candidates can expect.\n\n*   **2 x Coding** (1 hour). These interviews will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-coding)\n     below.\n*   **1-2 x System design** (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-design)\n     below.\n*   **1-3 Behavioral** (1 hour). For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section](https://interviewing.io/roblox-interview-questions#question-behavior)\n     below.\n\n### Step 4: Bar Raiser Interview\n\nIf you pass the onsite, the final round will be a bar raiser interview. The style of this interview is unique to Roblox. They will give you a technical problem, likely one they have faced at Roblox in the past, but it will be designed to take you out of your comfort zone. It’s not a coding exercise but more a test of your creativity, intelligence, values and ability to navigate tricky situations.\n\nAn example of the type of technical problem might be that people are finding ways to bypass the Roblox moderation system and post inappropriate content.\n\nThe problem \\[in the Bar Raiser interview\\] will be something uncomfortable for you - something you can’t assign normal CS best practices to. It’ll be a weird situation.\n\n> _The problem \\[in the Bar Raiser interview\\] will be something uncomfortable for you - something you can’t assign normal CS best practices to. It’ll be a weird situation._\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Roblox\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nRoblox’s coding questions will be LeetCode medium in terms of difficulty but won’t necessarily be LeetCode-style. They will try to place problems in a situational context that is relevant to the type of work you will do there, although you will use algorithms and data structures in your solutions. They aren’t trying to trick you with anything too difficult, but they do want to see clean code. For Roblox, it’s not just about solving the problem, you have to write clean code, run test cases, compile the code etc.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Roblox interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Roblox engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Search](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Dynamic Programming](https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=dynamic-programming)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n### System Design\n\nRoblox’s system design rounds come in two different styles. One is a standard system design round, and the other is a deep dive into a system you have previously designed or been involved in. If you only get one round during the onsite, it will likely be the former.\n\nFor the standard interview, you might be asked to build something like Minesweeper. For the project deep dive, you will be asked to explain how you built something and what the tradeoffs were.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nYou might have as many as 3 behavioral rounds at Roblox. They can be with the engineering manager, director of engineering and/or VP of engineering overseeing the role you are interviewing for. The interview with the engineering manager and director are standard behavioral interviews, where you will be posed situational questions, and can use something like the STAR method to answer them.\n\nThe VP interview is different. It can seem more casual in terms of their tone, but it’s a really critical interview. If you get one of these interviews it’s a good sign that other rounds have gone well, but it is also a round many fail due to treating it casually. They will likely start by going through your resume but will find something to drill down into. They want to hire engineers they can be proud of, so if you have something on your resume, be prepared to justify why it is there and why it makes you a good hire. You might get asked about the project you’re most proud of. Don’t just give them a project that had a successful outcome; show them something that makes you stand out.\n\n> _Don’t be just a nice guy, be impressive, think about your resume and your stories._\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Search](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Dynamic Programming](https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=dynamic-programming)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)",

They can be with the engineering manager, director of engineering and/or VP of engineering overseeing the role you are interviewing for. The interview with the engineering manager and director are standard behavioral interviews, where you will be posed situational questions, and can use something like the STAR method to answer them.\n\nThe VP interview is different. It can seem more casual in terms of their tone, but it’s a really critical interview. If you get one of these interviews it’s a good sign that other rounds have gone well, but it is also a round many fail due to treating it casually. They will likely start by going through your resume but will find something to drill down into. They want to hire engineers they can be proud of, so if you have something on your resume, be prepared to justify why it is there and why it makes you a good hire. You might get asked about the project you’re most proud of. Don’t just give them a project that had a successful outcome; show them something that makes you stand out.\n\n> _Don’t be just a nice guy, be impressive, think about your resume and your stories._\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Each of their orgs is called [_Something_ Cloud](https://rainmakercloud.com/blog/2022/01/18/the-15-types-of-clouds-in-salesforce-and-their-features)\n, so if you’re interviewing at the org level, it might be for, say, Marketing Cloud or IoT Cloud, and which team you end up on will be determined after you interview. That said, how each team or org runs their own process is up to them.\n\nIf you end up applying to an org rather than a specific team, you'll do team matching within the org _before_ you get your offer numbers.\n\nFinally, our sources tell us that while Salesforce is pretty quick to move for a company of their size once you actually start interviewing. The time from the first interview to offer can take as little as 3 weeks, but they may take a while to get that first interview scheduled.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, where they’ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you’re interested in Salesforce and the specific team/org you’re targeting. They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nOne important thing – if you’re primarily a back-end engineer, let your recruiter know as soon as possible so they route you accordingly. If you don’t, and you end up saying you’re full-stack when you’re really not (or when you haven’t touched front-end work in a long time), you might be in for a rude awakening in your coding rounds when you have to traverse the DOM or build progress bars in JavaScript. Even though “full-stack” can mean any number of different things depending on the company, at Salesforce, they really mean it!\n\nFinally, it’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664411636&usg=AOvVaw2y437xxXrTm2-9NHDgDz1y)\n. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe structure and content of the technical phone screen at Salesforce is team-dependent, as is tooling. One tool you’re likely to see, though, is [Quip](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quip.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664412626&usg=AOvVaw2T-Hsd2TxcJCXmUQdS56j8)\n (their answer to Google docs).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nSalesforce’s onsite lasts roughly 4 hours and consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Coding (2 hours)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Behavioral (1 hour)\n\n#### Coding\n\nSalesforce’s onsite usually has 2 coding interviews. As with the technical phone screen, tooling varies, but you might have to use Quip (their answer to Google docs).\n\nThese are the most important parts of the onsite – both the system design and the behavioral rounds don’t carry as much weight.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThis round lasts 1 hour and may also happen in Quip.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThe behavioral round is probably the least important out of all the onsite rounds. You’ll get the usual questions about past projects, your contributions, strengths and weaknesses, and so on.\n\nThat said, Salesforce really values [the concept of Ohana (family)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.salesforceben.com/what-is-the-salesforce-ohana/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664414005&usg=AOvVaw07sLrrAY1tLtQnQilgsbZ6)\n, and you may get questions about the importance of community, supporting your team, the importance of customer relationships, and so on.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Salesforce\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nOne unique aspect of this round is more of an emphasis on specific programming language skills (rather than the type of language-agnostic interview you might see at FAANGs and many FAANG-adjacent companies).\n\nMoreover, if you’re applying for a full-stack role, you may get front-end or back-end questions, and which you get is up to your interviewer. One typical question is, “Build a progress bar in JavaScript”. If you’re primarily a back-end engineer who’s done some front-end work in the distant past, questions like this may be really jarring..\n\nIt’s less likely than at other companies that you’ll get LeetCode-style questions, but you might (again, what you get is team-dependent). However, if you do get them, they’re going to be easy to medium (rather than medium to hard, as you might see with other companies we’ve written about), and our sources tell us that if you practice the top 10 medium-difficulty questions on LeetCode, you’ll be in good shape.\n\nBetween the above and cross-referencing it with our own data-set of mock interviews, if you do get back-end, algorithmic questions in your coding interviews, these are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Trees](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Linked Lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 13  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n### System Design\n\nThe kinds of questions you’ll get here vary a lot from team to team and may be anything from database-related questions (including writing SQL) to design questions about CRMs (not surprising, given that Salesforce is a CRM company).\n\nYou should also study up on the internal tooling the org/team you’re interviewing for uses, as you are likely to get questions about that (e.g., [technologies they’ve acquired somewhat recently](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.salesforceben.com/the-10-biggest-salesforce-acquisitions/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664415978&usg=AOvVaw2o8Gsi-xA72ccuDkWEvMRj)\n like Slack, Quip, Tableau, etc.).\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\nCommon Salesforce Interview Questions\n-------------------------------------\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Salesforce ask on our platform.

As with the technical phone screen, tooling varies, but you might have to use Quip (their answer to Google docs).\n\nThese are the most important parts of the onsite – both the system design and the behavioral rounds don’t carry as much weight.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThis round lasts 1 hour and may also happen in Quip.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThe behavioral round is probably the least important out of all the onsite rounds. You’ll get the usual questions about past projects, your contributions, strengths and weaknesses, and so on.\n\nThat said, Salesforce really values [the concept of Ohana (family)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.salesforceben.com/what-is-the-salesforce-ohana/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687335664414005&usg=AOvVaw07sLrrAY1tLtQnQilgsbZ6)\n, and you may get questions about the importance of community, supporting your team, the importance of customer relationships, and so on.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Salesforce\n----------------------------------------------------",

One typical question is, “Build a progress bar in JavaScript”. If you’re primarily a back-end engineer who’s done some front-end work in the distant past, questions like this may be really jarring..\n\nIt’s less likely than at other companies that you’ll get LeetCode-style questions, but you might (again, what you get is team-dependent). However, if you do get them, they’re going to be easy to medium (rather than medium to hard, as you might see with other companies we’ve written about), and our sources tell us that if you practice the top 10 medium-difficulty questions on LeetCode, you’ll be in good shape.\n\nBetween the above and cross-referencing it with our own data-set of mock interviews, if you do get back-end, algorithmic questions in your coding interviews, these are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Trees](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Linked Lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 13  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-tables)",

Its purpose is to check qualifications, hear about past projects, and find out what you’re looking for from Shopify and in general. It also acts as a culture fit check, so they’ll want to see how your communication and personality align with their values. Make sure you’re up to date on Shopify features, blog posts and news. Finally, your recruiter will make sure you understand the role you’re applying for and clarify next steps in the process.  \n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, but shorter. It’s primarily meant to gauge your interest in Shopify and lay out the rest of the process. There will be a more detailed recruiter call, called the “Life Story” interview, later on.\n\nThat said, it’s still really important not to reveal your salary expectations or your salary history. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.\n\nNormally, we’d also advise you not to reveal where you are in process with other companies, but we’ve heard from our sources that Shopify is very good at moving quickly if you’re getting close to offer stage with other companies, so if you need them to move, make sure to mention that in this call (you don’t have to go into detail about which companies you’re talking to, just that you’re getting close to offers or have some already).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen at Shopify is a data structures/algorithms interview conducted via CoderPad. There will likely be 2 interviewers conducting this round.\n\n### Step 3: \"Life Story\" interview\n\nThis interview is conducted by a recruiter, who will be asking you questions about your past to see what motivates and drives you: is there some common thread that’s been a theme or shown up in multiple places in your story and your career to date? Their goal is to suss out whether you’re a “3D person” who can communicate effectively with others, instead of just someone who’s technically gifted. Because Shopify is fully remote, they place extra importance on having employees who are personable and able to have a chat.\n\nYou may also be asked to sign [Shopify’s code of conduct](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_downloads/Governance%20document/2019/Code-of-Conduct-as-amended-May-29-2019.pdf)\n (we were able to find this copy from 2019; please email us to let us know if it’s no longer valid).\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nShopify’s onsite lasts roughly 4 hours and includes the following steps:\n\n*   Pair programming (2 hours)\n*   Technical deep dive (1 hour)\n*   Possibly system design (1 hour; usually just for senior/staff-level engineers)\n\n#### Pair Programming/Coding\n\nYou’ll have two separate pair programming sessions as part of your onsite.\n\nIn these interviews, you’ll be using your IDE of choice and sharing your screen.\n\nWhen you practice for this interview, get in the habit of talking out loud about what may work even if it's not ideal, and explain to the interviewer what you would do differently, or how you would improve it if you had more time. The goal isn’t just to solve the problem, but to show that you know what you’re doing and are able to consider the long-term effects of your design decisions.\n\n#### Technical Deep Dive\n\nIn this interview, you’ll be doing a deep dive on a project you worked on, why it mattered, your contributions, how you overcame challenges, and so on. Be prepared to discuss technical details in depth.\n\n#### System Design\n\nYou may not get a separate system design interview in your loop – those are reserved for senior (and sometimes staff-level candidates). There will be a system design component in your pair programming sessions, however.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Shopify\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding/Pair Programming\n\nYou’re more likely to get LeetCode-style questions in the technical phone screen, rather than the onsite.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Shopify interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Shopify interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with our own data-set of mock interviews.

          "content": "### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThe first recruiter call lasts 30 minutes. Its purpose is to check qualifications, hear about past projects, and find out what you’re looking for from Shopify and in general. It also acts as a culture fit check, so they’ll want to see how your communication and personality align with their values. Make sure you’re up to date on Shopify features, blog posts and news. Finally, your recruiter will make sure you understand the role you’re applying for and clarify next steps in the process.  \n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, but shorter. It’s primarily meant to gauge your interest in Shopify and lay out the rest of the process. There will be a more detailed recruiter call, called the “Life Story” interview, later on.\n\nThat said, it’s still really important not to reveal your salary expectations or your salary history. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.\n\nNormally, we’d also advise you not to reveal where you are in process with other companies, but we’ve heard from our sources that Shopify is very good at moving quickly if you’re getting close to offer stage with other companies, so if you need them to move, make sure to mention that in this call (you don’t have to go into detail about which companies you’re talking to, just that you’re getting close to offers or have some already).",

Their goal is to suss out whether you’re a “3D person” who can communicate effectively with others, instead of just someone who’s technically gifted. Because Shopify is fully remote, they place extra importance on having employees who are personable and able to have a chat.\n\nYou may also be asked to sign [Shopify’s code of conduct](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_downloads/Governance%20document/2019/Code-of-Conduct-as-amended-May-29-2019.pdf)\n (we were able to find this copy from 2019; please email us to let us know if it’s no longer valid).",

The goal isn’t just to solve the problem, but to show that you know what you’re doing and are able to consider the long-term effects of your design decisions.\n\n#### Technical Deep Dive\n\nIn this interview, you’ll be doing a deep dive on a project you worked on, why it mattered, your contributions, how you overcame challenges, and so on. Be prepared to discuss technical details in depth.\n\n#### System Design\n\nYou may not get a separate system design interview in your loop – those are reserved for senior (and sometimes staff-level candidates). There will be a system design component in your pair programming sessions, however.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Shopify\n-------------------------------------------------",

Instead of Leadership Principles, they evaluate candidates on their adherence to Snap’s values: “We are Kind, “We are Smart”, and “We are Creative”. Note that Snap’s behavioral evaluations are spread across all of your interviews, so, unlike most companies, there isn’t a dedicated behavioral interview. Make sure to keep the Snap values in mind during your rounds. They’re also looking for product knowledge and passion for Snap in every interview, so make sure you’re familiar with the app and ready to talk about it. Review their values and specifically their engineering values before heading into your interviews!\n\nFinally, Snap has a bar that’s been described to us as “unexpectedly high”, and exactly how high can vary from team to team.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nSnap’s recruiter call is pretty typical, but in addition to the standard recruiter questions, they may ask you product questions or want to hear about your usage of the app and its features. Be sure to spend some time playing around with their product before going in.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen at Snap is a data structures/algorithms interview via HackerRank (their interview tool, not the async assessment tool). Depending on the interviewer, there may also be some light behavioral questions in this round (as we mentioned earlier, behavioral questions will be sprinkled throughout the process).\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite at Snap consists of 6 interview rounds with the following steps:\n\n*   Coding (4 hours)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Q&A (30 minutes to 1 hour)\n\n#### Coding\n\nThere are generally four interviews focused on algorithms and data structures. The main thing they’re looking for besides a working solution that actually runs is speed.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThe [system design interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n at Snap will focus on high-level system design questions and will likely expect a tie into a feature/design relevant to their product.\n\n#### Q&A\n\nOnce you’ve wrapped up your technical interviews, you’ll get the chance to chat with a hiring manager and ask any burning questions you may have about Snap. This round isn’t meant to be an evaluation and does not factor into whether you get an offer.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Snap\n----------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nSnap's coding questions come from a company-wide question bank and are usually LeetCode-style questions ranging from medium to hard difficulty.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Snap interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Snap interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:\n\n[Sets](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sets)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Queues](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=queue)\n\n### System Design\n\nTypical questions include:\n\n*   Design a chat app\n*   Design an ad server\n*   Design a photo sharing app\n*   Design a document management system\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\nCommon Snap Interview Questions\n-------------------------------\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Snap ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Reverse a Linked List](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-linked-list)\n\n[Given the head of a linked list, reverse the list and return the new head.](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-linked-list)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Copy List With Random Pointers](https://interviewing.io/questions/copy-list-with-random-pointers)\n\n[Given a linked list with nodes that have an additional pointer referring to another node in the list, return a deep copy of the list.](https://interviewing.io/questions/copy-list-with-random-pointers)\n\nHow Snap Makes Hiring Decisions\n-------------------------------\n\nOnce you’ve wrapped up your onsite, you’ll be given an offer based on the performance in the technical interviews, decided by your interviewers. Once you receive and accept your offer, you’ll begin the team matching process (given that team matching comes after an offer in their process, we didn’t officially include it as part of the interview).\n\nThis process can take several weeks (or longer in some cases), and consists of multiple calls with different interested hiring managers from across Snap.\n\nSnap Interview Replays\n----------------------\n\n[![Deep copy linked list](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Snap_1_f3fbacca55.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nSnap Interviewer\\\n\\\nDeep copy linked list\\\n\\\nDJ Cyclone, a Snap engineer, interviewed Massively Parallel Hedgehog in Python](https://interviewing.io/mocks/snap-python-deep-copy-linked-list)\n\n[![Copy list with random pointers](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Snap_2_65608ecd94.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nSnap Interviewer\\\n\\\nCopy list with random pointers\\\n\\\nDJ Cyclone, a Snap engineer, interviewed Parallel Prism in C++](https://interviewing.io/mocks/snap-cplus-plus)\n\n[![Print linked list reverse](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Snap_3_0c0955c3f8.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nSnap Interviewer\\\n\\\nPrint linked list reverse\\\n\\\nDJ Cyclone, a Snap engineer, interviewed Epic Rainbow in C++](https://interviewing.io/mocks/cplusplus-print-linked-list-reverse)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Snap?

You’ll also generally be interviewing with members of the team you’ve applied to.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nSnowflake’s recruiter call is pretty typical. They’ll ask about your background and interests, and how they relate to the role you’re interviewing for. In some cases this call will also replace the hiring manager call, depending on if the recruiter is aware of exactly what the hiring manager of the specific team is looking for.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Hiring Manager Call\n\nWhether you talk to a hiring manager or not depends on which team you’re applying for and the relationship that the hiring manager and the recruiter have – if the hiring manager feels that the recruiter is well-calibrated, they may opt to skip this step.\n\nIn the event that you do speak with a hiring manager, they’ll talk to you about your background and see how well it fits with the role and their specific team. They’re looking to see how well your passions, interests, and previous experience ties into the Snowflake values as well, and how it will translate into your role. Ideally, they’d like to see some overlap in your hobbies and the things you’ll be doing at work.\n\nThe hiring managers at Snowflake are encouraged to share all good candidates with other teams, so even if you’re not a good fit for their exact team, they may help you find something else.\n\n### Step 3: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe technical phone screen at Snowflake consists of BOTH a data structures/algorithms interview AND A system design interview. That’s why it takes 2 hours. These are conducted via CoderPad and Zoom.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nIn addition to having a strong back-end focus, Snowflake’s interviews test your ability to perform within a specific team. It’s also important to note that since Snowflake is a database company, a lot of the interview questions will involve having some more database expertise and knowledge than your average company.\n\nSnowflake’s onsite is usually virtual and takes place over Zoom using CoderPad. While the type/amount of rounds may vary from team to team, generally you can expect to see the following depending on your level:\n\n##### **Mid-to-senior (IC3 and 4):**\n\n*   **Presentation (30 minutes)**: This interview is usually with multiple engineers from the team you’re applying for and is an opportunity to showcase a past project in a way that highlights your technical ability and foundational knowledge.\n*   **Coding (1 hour)**\n*   **Expertise (1 hour)**: This is a technical interview that will touch on skills relevant for the specific team you’re interviewing for. It may be coding, system design, or both. Or it could be a deep dive into a specific language or framework (again depending on the team).\n*   **Behavioral (1 hour)**: This interview is usually with a project manager but sometimes a hiring manager will do it, depending on your team.\n*   **Close (1 hour)**: This is a final call, with a recruiter or a senior leader (depending on the team), to answer any last questions about the role and team, and to potentially wrap up any loose ends from previous rounds.\n\n##### **Principal (IC5 and above):**\n\n*   **Presentation (30 minutes)**: Same as mid-level above.\n*   **Coding (1 hour)**\n*   **Expertise (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.\n*   **Behavioral (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.\n*   **Cross-functional (1 hour)**: This will be an interview with members from multiple teams across Snowflake who will come prepared with their own questions as it pertains to their department and your potential team.\n*   **Close (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Snowflake\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nFor coding interviews, you can expect algorithmic questions that are around a LeetCode medium, but with a Snowflake-specific twist and a focus on database internals. An example question is: Get a log file, aggregate the logs, and do it in a way that won’t take too long.\n\nEven if the questions aren’t pure LeetCode, they will touch on a variety of technical topics. As such, to figure out what technical topics to expect in your Snowflake interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Snowflake interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes with our own data-set of mock interviews. Based on all of the above, here are the types of questions you’re likely to encounter:\n\n[Binary Trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-trees)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Hash Tables](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Memoization](https://interviewing.io/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=memoization)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis interview will focus more on data systems and database design, and the generic “Design Instagram” types of questions are much less common.\n\nAn example question could be: Take in events that happened at a certain time, keep track of and organize them so that you can retrieve them quickly, and insert new events quickly while keeping track of the tradeoffs.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\nCommon Snowflake Interview Questions\n------------------------------------\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Snowflake ask on our platform. Since our data comes from mock interviews, questions may not be exactly the same as what you'd see in real interviews.\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Decode String](https://interviewing.io/questions/decode-string)\n\n[Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.](https://interviewing.io/questions/decode-string)\n\n### How Snowflake Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nOnce you’ve finished your onsite, the team you’re interviewing with at Snowflake will meet and discuss your performance, review the interviews and make a decision. This usually takes a few days, after which you’ll receive feedback for each round and find out whether or not there’s an offer.\n\nSnowflake Interview Replays\n---------------------------\n\n[![Decode string](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Snowflake_1_7e14aae6af.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nSnowflake Interviewer\\\n\\\nDecode string\\\n\\\nSupreme Kraken, a Snowflake engineer, interviewed Stealthy Hawk in Python](https://interviewing.io/mocks/snowflake-python-decode-string)\n\n[![ID generator](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Snowflake_2_1e71c2aa2c.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nSnowflake Interviewer\\\n\\\nID generator\\\n\\\nWinged Avenger, a Snowflake engineer, interviewed Ghost Koala in C++](https://interviewing.io/mocks/cplusplus-id-generator)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Snowflake?

Or it could be a deep dive into a specific language or framework (again depending on the team).\n*   **Behavioral (1 hour)**: This interview is usually with a project manager but sometimes a hiring manager will do it, depending on your team.\n*   **Close (1 hour)**: This is a final call, with a recruiter or a senior leader (depending on the team), to answer any last questions about the role and team, and to potentially wrap up any loose ends from previous rounds.\n\n##### **Principal (IC5 and above):**\n\n*   **Presentation (30 minutes)**: Same as mid-level above.\n*   **Coding (1 hour)**\n*   **Expertise (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.\n*   **Behavioral (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.\n*   **Cross-functional (1 hour)**: This will be an interview with members from multiple teams across Snowflake who will come prepared with their own questions as it pertains to their department and your potential team.\n*   **Close (1 hour)**: Same as mid-level above.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Snowflake\n---------------------------------------------------",

An example question is: Get a log file, aggregate the logs, and do it in a way that won’t take too long.\n\nEven if the questions aren’t pure LeetCode, they will touch on a variety of technical topics. As such, to figure out what technical topics to expect in your Snowflake interviews, we did 2 things. First, we spoke to some current and former Snowflake interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes with our own data-set of mock interviews.

You apply to a general job posting, and the recruiting team will decide if they want to have a call. After you speak with them, they will shortlist your profile and show it to different hiring managers. If a hiring manager thinks there is a good fit, you’ll move forward to speak with them. If you make it through that call and an offline coding assessment, you’ll head to the onsite phase where you’ll be interviewed by engineers from the hiring manager’s team.\n\nTo work at SpaceX you need to be a permanent resident and/or citizen of the United States.\n\nFrom what we’ve been told, the entire process can take about four weeks.\n\nGeneral advice:\n\n*   Go onsite in person. They put a lot of stock in personal relationships, and visiting the site is worth it!\n*   They don’t need you to get to full solutions, focus on asking the right questions and showing them how you think about the problems.\n*   LeetCode is helpful for practice, but they are really looking for your ability to solve real-world challenges and pull from your experience.\n*   Invest a lot of time in the presentation\n*   Know [Elon Musk's 5-step Design Process](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/musks-5-step-design-process)\n    .\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nSpaceX’s recruiter call lasts 15 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you’re interested in SpaceX\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Hiring Manager Call\n\nThis is usually a hybrid call, with some questions about your experience and some technical questions. As the hiring manager has picked your profile from a shortlist, they will have seen something in your background that they want to delve into. After that, you might get a system design question that relates to your previous work or the team you are interviewing with.\n\n### Step 3: Asynchronous Coding Assessment\n\nThis assessment should take you 3 hours, but you have 2 weeks to complete it. It takes place on Codility. Expect medium-level LeetCode questions that you can find online but with slightly different descriptions.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nThe onsite can be virtual or on-location. As above, try to actually go onsite if possible. Seeing the rockets alone is worth it but, they also like to meet people in person. You’ll get an additional 45 mins to have lunch with the recruiter. This is a great time to ask good questions and build rapport.\n\n*   **Facility tour** (if in person, 25 mins) The recruiter will walk you around the site.\n*   **Prepared project/source code presentation** (1 hour). You’ll be asked to suggest five ideas ahead of time, and they’ll pick the one they’d like you to present in person. The presentation will be in front of the entire team. This is a really important step in the process. You’ll be asked to present your project and some of the source code (if possible), and they will ask lots of questions throughout your presentation. Keep Elon Musk’s 5-step Design Process in mind here. They look for simplicity in your approach.\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This will likely be in CodeSignal. There might be some design elements here in addition to coding, and it will usually relate to SpaceX. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Lunch** (if onsite, 45 mins) This will be with the recruiter and is a great time for you to ask good questions.\n*   **Second Coding** (1 hour). This will likely be in CodeSignal and is usually conducted by two interviewers. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour) For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour) This interview is with the hiring manager. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at SpaceX\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nDon’t expect LeetCode-style questions at the onsite stage. Instead, you’ll see hybrid questions that have an algorithmic component, a coding component, and a design component. SpaceX likes to ask questions that make you think and draw on previous experience. A lot of their coding questions will bear some relation to real-world SpaceX problems. Talk through your approach, as it’s more important to show how you think than to reach a full solution.\n\nFrom one of our users who recently went through SpaceX interviews:\n\n> _The coding portion was more about normal logic and problem-solving design questions which did not require deep algorithmic knowledge: more about understanding the problem, asking the right questions, and providing SIMPLE and scalable design._\n\nA sample question might focus on spare parts for rockets and how to keep track of them as they move in and out of refrigeration. You may have to write code that tracks and logs the time each spare part is out, for instance.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in SpaceX interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former SpaceX engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\nOutside of the topics above, you may see questions about data hazards, memory management, and generally questions that get at your understanding of how programming works under the hood (e.g., compilers).\n\n### System Design\n\nHere you will likely be presented with a relatively straightforward design task but not given many details. For instance, you might be asked to design an inventory management system that involves multiple locations and items, similar to the example in the coding section above, except that in this interview, you’ll be focusing more on the design and less on the coding parts. In the inventory management system question, you’ll have to:\n\n*   Design database tables for managing spare part inventory\n*   Think about how to handle movement and transfers of items\n*   Discuss how you would do this at scale.\n\nNote that these questions will intentionally sound simple, and your interviewer will not provide a lot of details – they’re looking to see how you deal with ambiguity and how you ask questions to fill in the blanks.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThe behavioral interview is another critical step in the process. It’s possible that you perform well in this interview but poorly in one or more coding sessions yet remain in the process. If that happens’ you’ll likely be asked to do another coding interview.\n\nExpect to encounter similar questions to the [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles)\n type of interview during this round.\n\nOne engineer we spoke to also said they were asked how they felt about working with Product Managers. They told SpaceX it wasn’t always necessary to work with one and the interviewer seemed happy. It’s possible they do not have PMs.\n\n### How SpaceX Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nDecisions are at the hiring manager's discretion but they look for consensus. If you fail a round you might be asked to complete an additional interview. For example, if you fail one of the coding rounds, you might get another to complete.\n\nSee something inaccurate?

Seeing the rockets alone is worth it but, they also like to meet people in person. You’ll get an additional 45 mins to have lunch with the recruiter. This is a great time to ask good questions and build rapport.\n\n*   **Facility tour** (if in person, 25 mins) The recruiter will walk you around the site.\n*   **Prepared project/source code presentation** (1 hour). You’ll be asked to suggest five ideas ahead of time, and they’ll pick the one they’d like you to present in person. The presentation will be in front of the entire team. This is a really important step in the process. You’ll be asked to present your project and some of the source code (if possible), and they will ask lots of questions throughout your presentation. Keep Elon Musk’s 5-step Design Process in mind here. They look for simplicity in your approach.\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This will likely be in CodeSignal. There might be some design elements here in addition to coding, and it will usually relate to SpaceX. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/spacex-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Lunch** (if onsite, 45 mins) This will be with the recruiter and is a great time for you to ask good questions.\n*   **Second Coding** (1 hour).

          "content": "### Coding\n\nDon’t expect LeetCode-style questions at the onsite stage. Instead, you’ll see hybrid questions that have an algorithmic component, a coding component, and a design component. SpaceX likes to ask questions that make you think and draw on previous experience. A lot of their coding questions will bear some relation to real-world SpaceX problems. Talk through your approach, as it’s more important to show how you think than to reach a full solution.\n\nFrom one of our users who recently went through SpaceX interviews:\n\n> _The coding portion was more about normal logic and problem-solving design questions which did not require deep algorithmic knowledge: more about understanding the problem, asking the right questions, and providing SIMPLE and scalable design._\n\nA sample question might focus on spare parts for rockets and how to keep track of them as they move in and out of refrigeration. You may have to write code that tracks and logs the time each spare part is out, for instance.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in SpaceX interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former SpaceX engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Stacks](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=stacks)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\nOutside of the topics above, you may see questions about data hazards, memory management, and generally questions that get at your understanding of how programming works under the hood (e.g., compilers).",

For instance, you might be asked to design an inventory management system that involves multiple locations and items, similar to the example in the coding section above, except that in this interview, you’ll be focusing more on the design and less on the coding parts. In the inventory management system question, you’ll have to:\n\n*   Design database tables for managing spare part inventory\n*   Think about how to handle movement and transfers of items\n*   Discuss how you would do this at scale.\n\nNote that these questions will intentionally sound simple, and your interviewer will not provide a lot of details – they’re looking to see how you deal with ambiguity and how you ask questions to fill in the blanks.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.",

Usually, you will meet the hiring manager and one other engineer on the team. The rest of your interviewers will be from other teams. One exception to this rule is high-profile teams, in which case you may meet with 2 different engineers from that team.\n\nBecause you’re interviewing with a specific team from the outset, there is no additional matching round. However, for open-ended roles or in cases where you did well in your interviews, but the original team wasn’t a fit for whatever reason, they’ll pass you to a call with hiring managers where they sell you on joining their teams instead.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, where they’ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you’re interested in Spotify. They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThe exact process can vary from team to team. Generally, you’re asked technical trivia questions and some values-based questions, followed by coding.\n\nHow interviews are conducted also varies. The most frequently used tools are Coderpad, HackerRank, and in some cases, you’ll be asked to share your screen and use your IDE while you work through the problems you’re given.\n\nFinally, you may be asked to describe a past relevant project you’ve worked on. Make sure you’re prepared to demo and/or go into detail.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nSpotify’s onsite usually lasts 4 hours and consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Case Study (1 hour)\n*   Coding (1 hour)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Behavioral/Values (1 hour)\n\nThe order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that Spotify’s interview process is centralized, you generally won’t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you’ll end up on.\n\n#### Coding\n\nThe technical interview will consist of domain-specific questions, values-based questions, and a few medium to hard difficulty LeetCode-style questions.\n\nAs with the technical phone screen, tooling is team-dependent.\n\n#### System Design\n\nFor the system design interview, Spotify wants to see a broad and general understanding of the system design process, they'll also mix in domain specific questions. Generally the questions will follow the format of \"Design a system that does (x)\" with an opportunity for follow-up questions on scalability.\n\nSpotify uses [Mural](https://mural.co/)\n for system design interviews.\n\n#### Case Study\n\nThe most important round in Spotify’s onsite is the case study interview. In this interview, you’ll be presented with a very open-ended real-world problem that may require debugging a system to figure out what’s wrong with it or to figure out why some process has stalled.\n\nSome system design diagrams may be shared with you, along with fake terminals, code snippets, and so on.\n\nThis interview requires lots of dialogue and critical thinking, and the expectation is that you’ll ask your interviewer a bunch of questions. Successful candidates will have a broad understanding of the software engineering process itself, as well as a broad understanding of the system design process.\n\n#### Values/Behavioral\n\nSpotify places great importance on their values and on candidates being good culture fits. Their values are as follows:\n\n*   Innovative\n*   Collaborative\n*   Passionate\n*   Playful\n*   Sincere\n\nIn this interview, you’ll get a series of behavioral questions that try to get at the following (taken verbatim from their careers site):\n\n*   Do your values align with our values?\n*   Do you take ownership of your work and take pride in what you deliver?\n*   Are you adaptable?\n*   Are you collaborative?\n*   Are you driven?\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Spotify\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThis interview usually has a few medium to hard difficulty LeetCode-style questions.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your Spotify interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Spotify interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.

They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies.

          "content": "### Step 3: Onsite\n\nSpotify’s onsite usually lasts 4 hours and consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Case Study (1 hour)\n*   Coding (1 hour)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Behavioral/Values (1 hour)\n\nThe order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that Spotify’s interview process is centralized, you generally won’t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you’ll end up on.\n\n#### Coding\n\nThe technical interview will consist of domain-specific questions, values-based questions, and a few medium to hard difficulty LeetCode-style questions.\n\nAs with the technical phone screen, tooling is team-dependent.\n\n#### System Design\n\nFor the system design interview, Spotify wants to see a broad and general understanding of the system design process, they'll also mix in domain specific questions. Generally the questions will follow the format of \"Design a system that does (x)\" with an opportunity for follow-up questions on scalability.\n\nSpotify uses [Mural](https://mural.co/)\n for system design interviews.\n\n#### Case Study\n\nThe most important round in Spotify’s onsite is the case study interview. In this interview, you’ll be presented with a very open-ended real-world problem that may require debugging a system to figure out what’s wrong with it or to figure out why some process has stalled.\n\nSome system design diagrams may be shared with you, along with fake terminals, code snippets, and so on.\n\nThis interview requires lots of dialogue and critical thinking, and the expectation is that you’ll ask your interviewer a bunch of questions. Successful candidates will have a broad understanding of the software engineering process itself, as well as a broad understanding of the system design process.\n\n#### Values/Behavioral\n\nSpotify places great importance on their values and on candidates being good culture fits. Their values are as follows:\n\n*   Innovative\n*   Collaborative\n*   Passionate\n*   Playful\n*   Sincere\n\nIn this interview, you’ll get a series of behavioral questions that try to get at the following (taken verbatim from their careers site):\n\n*   Do your values align with our values?\n*   Do you take ownership of your work and take pride in what you deliver?\n*   Are you adaptable?\n*   Are you collaborative?\n*   Are you driven?\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Spotify\n-------------------------------------------------",

We’ll get to that later.\n\n![Stripe's interview process: Recruiter call, Technical phone screen, Recruiter Call, Onsite](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Stripe_s_Company_Process_938ad18527.png)\n\nStripe has a hybrid process. Their eng team is divided into two orgs: Product and Infrastructure. You interview for a specific org, but your interview loop will have engineers involved from across the company, as well as a hiring manager from the specific org you are interviewing for. There is likely some flexibility in terms of which team in that org you end up on. That discussion usually happens post-onsite. You will have the opportunity to discuss team placement during the onsite interview with the hiring manager.\n\nThe entire process takes about 6 weeks but can be completed in as little as 2 weeks, particularly if you are a referral, according to our sources.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nStripe’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, why you’re interested in Stripe, your understanding of Stripe’s value proposition, and what you’re looking for moving forward. They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. [We’ve written a detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nStripe’s technical phone screen lasts about an hour. You can use either your own IDE and share your screen or you can just use CoderPad. They leave it up to you; whatever you’re most comfortable with.\n\nExpect the unexpected here i.e., they won’t ask standard LeetCode-style questions. We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called \"[Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Stripe](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-types)\n\" below.\n\nThe hiring managers at Stripe are encouraged to share all good candidates with other teams, so even if you’re not a good fit for their exact team, they may help you find something else.\n\n### Step 3: Second Recruiter Call\n\nThis is an informational call to help prepare you for the onsite.\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nAt this point, candidates split into different loops depending on the role they are interviewing for e.g., ML, frontend, backend etc. Onsite interview loops also vary slightly depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get:\n\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in either your own IDE with screen-share or in CoderPad. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in either your own drawing tool with screen-share or in Whimsical. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Bug bash** (1 hour). You’ll be given a piece of code and will have to find the bug(s). They usually pick something that they’ve actually seen before, so it will be a generic version of a real Stripe bug. In this round, they’re looking for you to approach the problem thoughtfully and test different approaches, rather than just barreling into something and hitting a wall\n*   **\\[For roles below Staff\\] Integrations** (1 hour). You’ll be asked to use the Stripe API here, and it will be based on real-world integrations they've seen their merchant customers create. If you interview in the Integrations org, you will not get this round.\n*   **\\[For Staff roles and above\\] Presentation** (1 hour). You’ll have to write a one pager about a past project and present this to a staff-level engineer, and one other, more junior engineer who will take notes. You’ll be asked to explain it, and the panel will assess your ability to communicate both via written word and to a live technical audience. They want to test your ability to give business context or rationale for what you did, and your ability to justify technical decisions. They may also ask you what you’d do in situations where constraints changed on the fly. They will assess the scope of the project and probe for your use of soft power to get the project done. This interview is particularly important for leveling – if candidates can’t effectively communicate the business impact of their work, for instance, they may be down-leveled.\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager or a “Leveler” – someone who interviews across a lot of levels and tries to maintain a consistent bar, similar to a Bar Raiser at [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n    . For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Stripe\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAll of Stripe’s interview questions are created in-house. They run questions through tests internally via mock interviews. They are tested for fairness and fun-ness. Don’t expect industry standard questions here. Be prepared to encounter something unusual but hopefully interesting! Stripe really values proactivity and independent thinking so their questions are aimed at testing you for those skill sets.\n\nStripe’s questions are language-agnostic but might change a little bit depending on the language used. They playtest the questions internally to figure out if they are easier or more difficult in certain languages, and the interviewer will adjust as needed during your interview.\n\n“Stripe is not for everyone” is something we heard often while writing this piece. You get a lot of freedom to do things you think are important, but that comes with the responsibility to deliver. If you thrive in that kind of culture you’ll do well, but if you like to operate in a more rigid structure with very clear instructions and deliverables, you might not enjoy it there.\n\nStripe does not ask LeetCode questions, and grinding on LeetCode may end up being counterproductive. Instead, they tend to be practical questions that originate with the work that Stripe engineers do every day. This means that while computer science fundamentals matter, questions designed to get at them will not be formulated the same way as LeetCode problems.\n\n### Coding\n\nThis interview will be less algorithms and data structures heavy than the LeetCode-style of interview you’re probably used to. Expect questions like:\n\n*   How would you build a simple version of Identity Access Management?\n*   How would you blur credit card numbers from logs?\n*   Design a rate limiter in any programming language\n\nRegardless of what question you get, they’ll ask about decision-making, time and space complexity, etc. They want to know why you would approach a problem in a certain way, and they look for things that might cause issues with client integrations, etc.\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Stripe interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Stripe engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Search](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n### System Design\n\nThis round focuses mostly on large systems and will involve designing an entire service with scalability, reliability, and usability concerns in mind. What technologies would you use and why? What are you optimizing for? Would you use a relational or non-relational database? How would caching work? And so on.\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis varies by role. For IC roles you’ll be asked about your own experiences. For management roles, you will be asked about how you would handle certain scenarios (e.g., underperforming direct reports, conflict in your org, etc.).\n\nLike Amazon, Stripe has some principles they harken back to when evaluating your responses. They’re called [Operating Principles](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture)\n (the analog to [Amazon’s Leadership Principles](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles)\n). Unlike Amazon, however, you won’t be asked behavioral questions in other rounds, just like this one.\n\n### How Stripe Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThe entire onsite panel submits written feedback after the interviews are completed and then meets to discuss. Most of the time, decisions are reached by consensus (everyone agrees to hire or no-hire), but in cases where consensus isn’t possible, the hiring manager has final say.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Stripe?

They’ll also review the specific role you’re applying for to make sure you understand the expectations and requirements and go over the hiring process.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies.

We will cover what we know of their question style in the section called \"[Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Stripe](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-types)\n\" below.\n\nThe hiring managers at Stripe are encouraged to share all good candidates with other teams, so even if you’re not a good fit for their exact team, they may help you find something else.",

This interview will be conducted in either your own IDE with screen-share or in CoderPad. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in either your own drawing tool with screen-share or in Whimsical. Your choice. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Bug bash** (1 hour). You’ll be given a piece of code and will have to find the bug(s). They usually pick something that they’ve actually seen before, so it will be a generic version of a real Stripe bug. In this round, they’re looking for you to approach the problem thoughtfully and test different approaches, rather than just barreling into something and hitting a wall\n*   **\\[For roles below Staff\\] Integrations** (1 hour). You’ll be asked to use the Stripe API here, and it will be based on real-world integrations they've seen their merchant customers create. If you interview in the Integrations org, you will not get this round.\n*   **\\[For Staff roles and above\\] Presentation** (1 hour). You’ll have to write a one pager about a past project and present this to a staff-level engineer, and one other, more junior engineer who will take notes. You’ll be asked to explain it, and the panel will assess your ability to communicate both via written word and to a live technical audience. They want to test your ability to give business context or rationale for what you did, and your ability to justify technical decisions. They may also ask you what you’d do in situations where constraints changed on the fly. They will assess the scope of the project and probe for your use of soft power to get the project done. This interview is particularly important for leveling – if candidates can’t effectively communicate the business impact of their work, for instance, they may be down-leveled.\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a hiring manager or a “Leveler” – someone who interviews across a lot of levels and tries to maintain a consistent bar, similar to a Bar Raiser at [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n    . For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/stripe-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Stripe\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAll of Stripe’s interview questions are created in-house. They run questions through tests internally via mock interviews. They are tested for fairness and fun-ness. Don’t expect industry standard questions here. Be prepared to encounter something unusual but hopefully interesting! Stripe really values proactivity and independent thinking so their questions are aimed at testing you for those skill sets.\n\nStripe’s questions are language-agnostic but might change a little bit depending on the language used. They playtest the questions internally to figure out if they are easier or more difficult in certain languages, and the interviewer will adjust as needed during your interview.\n\n“Stripe is not for everyone” is something we heard often while writing this piece. You get a lot of freedom to do things you think are important, but that comes with the responsibility to deliver. If you thrive in that kind of culture you’ll do well, but if you like to operate in a more rigid structure with very clear instructions and deliverables, you might not enjoy it there.\n\nStripe does not ask LeetCode questions, and grinding on LeetCode may end up being counterproductive. Instead, they tend to be practical questions that originate with the work that Stripe engineers do every day. This means that while computer science fundamentals matter, questions designed to get at them will not be formulated the same way as LeetCode problems.",

We have heard that certain teams do not allow this, but for the most part, it’s safe to apply to multiple positions. As each team manages its own headcount and process it is unlikely that you will be able to skip any steps for one team that you’ve already completed for another, i.e., you’ll still have to complete the full process each time. Your interviewers will all come from the team you are interviewing for.\n\nAs a lot of TikTok’s engineers are based in China, particularly their senior managers, you can expect to have interviews that overlap with Chinese business hours (e.g., Sunday evenings, other evenings).\n\nUnlike other companies where your virtual onsite will have all of your interviews scheduled on the same day, at TikTok you are likely to do one interview at a time, having to pass each one to get to the next.\n\nThe entire process takes about 5 weeks, although it can move much faster, especially if you let them know that you need to have your interviews complete by a certain date, e.g., if you have competing offers. TikTok is very amenable to moving quickly if they think there’s a chance they’ll lose out, but you’ll have to actively and repeatedly remind your recruiter to move faster.\n\nGeneral tips for interviewing with TikTok:\n\n*   Be prepared to interview during Chinese business hours and even to be asked questions in Mandarin if you’ve added it to your resume.\n*   Be prepared for huge variations in the process between teams. TikTok is hiring like crazy, and they don’t have an official process.\n*   Practice LeetCode-style questions! They rely heavily on these questions in your first few technical rounds.\n*   If you need them to move quickly, they can, but you have to really push and keep pushing. That goes for scheduling, and it goes for getting an offer in a timely fashion as well. If you keep bringing up that you have another offer, they’ll move.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nTikTok’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s more informational than anything else. You’ll be briefed on the process and prepared for the first interview. You may also be asked some questions about the company and your background.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\nIf you have offer deadlines coming up and need TikTok to move faster, mention that on this call, and keep reminding your recruiter of it. We’d advise not going into details about where you’re interviewing til you’re ready to start negotiating (read more how to manage your negotiations at the start of your job search), but we do advise hammering home the point that you’re in a rush (if you are).\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nTikTok’s first technical phone screen is relatively straightforward and should only take about 30 minutes. It’s usually done in HackerRank. If you brush up on LeetCode questions, you should do fine here.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nAt TikTok, there isn’t a discrete onsite portion of the hiring process. Instead, you will do each interview one by one and have to pass them one at a time to move forward. That said, once you get past the first technical screen, the order will look similar to other company’s onsite interviews. Onsite interview loops also vary depending on the role and seniority, but the below is generally what you’ll get:\n\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This is much more challenging than the technical phone screen and should last about an hour. The interview is usually conducted by someone on the team you are interviewing for and will use HackerRank. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be in HackerRank and will be conducted by a hiring manager on the team. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Behavioral** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted by a skip-level manager. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Behavioral section below](https://interviewing.io/tiktok-interview-questions#question-behavioral)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at TikTok\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe types of questions asked at TikTok vary by team, but you can expect a lot of industry-standard LeetCode-style questions.\n\n### Coding\n\nExpect LeetCode-style questions here. Most teams are language agnostic. The first interview will be fairly simple, based on feedback we’ve gotten. The second one is a lot harder. A few of the engineers we spoke to recommended brushing up on synchronized read/write locks for the second interview, in particular.\n\nOutside of concurrency and threading, below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in TikTok interviews.

Their teams are based mainly in China so that brings its own unique flavor, and you should be prepared for it.\n\n### How TikTok Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThis varies from team to team, but it’s likely at the discretion of the hiring manager, with input from other team members.\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at TikTok?

Right now, it looks to be a hybrid, and practically speaking, that means if you were to apply today, you might be matched with a specific team at the outset or you might do team matching at the end. We’ve seen both, and it appears to be a function of how niche your skills are (e.g., if you’re an ML engineer, you’ll likely be matched with a specific team at the outset).\n\nThat said, your interviewing panel will likely all be from the same org and use a company-wide, internal question bank. Candidates tend to interview for only one role, and though the process is somewhat standardized, the hiring manager will have a say in what the process will look like as well, so expect a little bit of variance.\n\nGeneral tips:\n\n*   LeetCode practice will help a lot with the coding portion. The system design interviews are pretty standard as well.\n*   They want you to write code that runs during coding rounds.\n*   Referrals will help; you may even be able to skip the technical phone screen with one.\n*   Be prepared to be grilled on your past experience and projects, particularly during the Collaboration and Leadership and Bar Raiser rounds.\n*   If you go through team matching, it may take a while (weeks to months).\n\nThe entire process takes about 4-6 weeks but possibly longer if you end up having to do team matching.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nUber’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll speak about the role and team you are interviewing for, discuss salary, location, and level expectations, and ask about your interest in Uber.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter)\n.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nAlthough we heard from one engineer that they were able to skip this stage with a referral, most senior engineers will get a pretty standard technical screen here. It will be conducted in CodeSignal, and there may be one or two questions. The questions themselves will be algorithmic. They have an internal bank of questions that most interviewers use, some of which are versions of real problems that Uber has had to solve in the past, and some of which are standard algorithmic questions with some Uber-isms papered over the top, but there does seem to be some variance. Either way, expect LeetCode medium in terms of difficulty.\n\nIt’s important to write fully compilable code here, i.e., code that runs. You should also run test cases.\n\nOne engineer, familiar with the process told us:\n\n> _You might get slightly harder questions first, and it’s OK to ask for help. If you do solve it without help, it’s a definite pass, but you can still pass with help assuming your communication skills etc. are good._\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThis will vary slightly by role but most engineers can expect something like this:\n\n*   **Coding** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **Second coding (depth in specialization)** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [Coding section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-coding)\n    .\n*   **System design** (1 hour). This interview will be conducted in CodeSignal. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the [System Design section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-design)\n    .\n*   **Collaboration and Leadership** (75 mins). This is with the hiring manager for the role. For more info about what questions to expect, see the [Collaboration and Leadership section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-collaboration)\n    .\n*   **Bar raiser** (1 hour) This is with a special bar raiser interviewer. For more infor about what questions to expect, the [Bar Raiser section below](https://interviewing.io/uber-interview-questions#question-bar-raiser)\n    .\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at Uber\n----------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nThis round will be just like the technical phone screen – they have an internal bank of questions that most interviewers use, some of which are versions of real problems that Uber has had to solve in the past, and some of which are standard algorithmic questions with some Uber-isms papered over the top. If you get LeetCode-style questions, they’ll be of medium difficulty or slightly harder. Note that you may get two questions, but if you do, they’ll likely be mediums.\n\nYou should get in the habit of running test cases, if it’s not something you do by default already..\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Uber interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Uber engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews:\n\n[Hash Maps](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Linked Lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 13  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=linked-lists)\n\n[Matrices](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Binary Search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 6  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=binary-search)\n\n[Parsing](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/parsing-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=parsing)\n\n[Arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 14  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=strings)\n\n[Graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \\\n& tips](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n### Second Coding (Depth of Specialization)\n\nWe’ve heard from multiple engineers that this round is sometimes just another LeetCode-style coding round but sometimes it’s not an algorithmic question at all. This round is meant to be more reflective of the role you are interviewing for and may include some design aspects.\n\nOne engineer we spoke with said:\n\n> _This round is supposed to be more focused on \\[a mix of code and\\] designing… where you might have to build a mobile game like Snake, but in reality it’s very similar to the first coding round, and interviewers often use something from the internal question bank._\n\nNote that your recruiter may not be prepared to set expectations for this round, as there seems to be a lot of variability in how it’s run, possibly at the request of the hiring manager. Ask as much as you can about the round beforehand, but be prepared for a possible curveball.\n\n### System Design\n\nMost of the people we interviewed told us to expect a very standard system design round, so you shouldn’t expect many surprises here. That said, they have an internal bank of questions that are based on old problems they had to solve at Uber so you might be asked to solve one of those. You might be asked to design a map that shows every Uber driver in the world. It won’t be a typical distributed systems question (like design a chat app), and you will need to focus on scale. Think about Uber in the early days and the problems they had to solve.\n\nYou’ll see other, more standard, questions such as:\n\n*   Design Dropbox\n*   Design Facebook Messenger\n*   Design a ride-sharing app (surprise!)\n*   Design a card game\n*   Design an industrial system\n\nCheck out [our guide to system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n to help you prepare.\n\n### Collaboration and Leadership\n\nThis interview will be conducted by the hiring manager for the role you are interviewing for, or in some cases, a hiring manager from the same org.\n\nThere seem to be two distinct styles used:\n\n*   You will be asked to go through past projects and how they were delivered\n*   You will be asked how you _would_ deliver potential projects\n\nThe hiring manager can take this in any direction they see fit,but they are looking to test your ability to work on a team, your ability to deal with failures, and your leadership skills. Have your past projects ready to discuss in detail, they might drill down into one specific project if it seems interesting. Be able to quantify both your impact and the impact of the project.\n\nIf the role is a speciality role, they might ask you questions that are relevant to it, e.g., if the role includes some frontend aspects, be prepared for some frontend questions.\n\n### Bar Raiser\n\nOk, this is where things get serious. If you’ve made it this far, it’s a good sign. We only spoke to one Uber engineer who did not get a bar raiser round and got hired. Everyone else told us that you need to pass one to get hired and that they sometimes won’t schedule it if the rest of your onsite hasn’t gone well.\n\nSimilar to [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon)\n, which is known for this type of interview, the bar raiser interviewer will be a specialty interviewer from across the company. They won’t be part of the team you are interviewing for. They will choose the focus on the interview. We’ve heard it’s usually a reverse system design / project introspection style of interview, but if you weren’t strong in one of the other onsite rounds, it might be a repeat of that.\n\nIf it is a reverse system design / project introspection interview, they will likely ask you to discuss one past project in deep detail. They will ask questions around:\n\n*   The technical complexity of the project\n*   The project’s impact\n*   The high level architecture decisions and the pros and cons associated\n*   The time it took to complete the project and/or reach each milestone\n*   Any failures\n\nBe prepared to quantify the project’s impact where possible. The project discussed should match the level of seniority you are interviewing for in terms of scale and scope. A staff engineer will need to talk about a project that spans at least 2 or 3 quarters of work for example, but a senior engineer can use something a little less complex. They are looking for your depth of knowledge here and this round is used for leveling. It’s probably the most important round you will have.\n\n### How Uber Makes Hiring Decisions\n\nThe entire interview panel meets, and the decision should be unanimous. If there is a mixed signal, people on the panel can try to convince others until they achieve consensus. Typically, one soft no-hire can be turned around, but one strong no-hire will be enough to reject you. In rare cases, the Bar Raiser interviewer can also overturn a hire decision.\n\nUber Interview Replays\n----------------------\n\n[![K closest elements](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Uber_2_c1be7b108e.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nUber Interviewer\\\n\\\nK closest elements\\\n\\\nBlue Centurion, an Uber engineer, interviewed Mutable Pigeon in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/uber-java-k-closest-elements)\n\nWant to know if you're ready to interview at Uber?

Note that you may get two questions, but if you do, they’ll likely be mediums.\n\nYou should get in the habit of running test cases, if it’s not something you do by default already..\n\nBelow are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Uber interviews.

We only spoke to one Uber engineer who did not get a bar raiser round and got hired. Everyone else told us that you need to pass one to get hired and that they sometimes won’t schedule it if the rest of your onsite hasn’t gone well.\n\nSimilar to [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon)\n, which is known for this type of interview, the bar raiser interviewer will be a specialty interviewer from across the company. They won’t be part of the team you are interviewing for. They will choose the focus on the interview. We’ve heard it’s usually a reverse system design / project introspection style of interview, but if you weren’t strong in one of the other onsite rounds, it might be a repeat of that.\n\nIf it is a reverse system design / project introspection interview, they will likely ask you to discuss one past project in deep detail. They will ask questions around:\n\n*   The technical complexity of the project\n*   The project’s impact\n*   The high level architecture decisions and the pros and cons associated\n*   The time it took to complete the project and/or reach each milestone\n*   Any failures\n\nBe prepared to quantify the project’s impact where possible. The project discussed should match the level of seniority you are interviewing for in terms of scale and scope. A staff engineer will need to talk about a project that spans at least 2 or 3 quarters of work for example, but a senior engineer can use something a little less complex. They are looking for your depth of knowledge here and this round is used for leveling. It’s probably the most important round you will have.",

If there is a mixed signal, people on the panel can try to convince others until they achieve consensus. Typically, one soft no-hire can be turned around, but one strong no-hire will be enough to reject you.

You interview for a specific team from the get-go, and not only the content of the interviews, but the types of interviews themselves, vary significantly from team to team, so take the list above with a grain of salt.\n\nOne other somewhat unique aspect of VMware’s process is their commitment to the Rooney Rule, i.e., [committing to interviewing at least one woman and one minority candidate for every open position](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/no-job-hire-made-unless-minority-candidate-interviewed-vmware-ceo.html)\n. In practice, sometimes the entire process for a role will get stalled until recruiting can find those candidates, and all candidates who are not from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds may end up in an indefinite holding pattern.\n\nFinally, a word about VMware’s eng culture. VMware wants to find very technical people who are interested in solving hard problems but also want to go home at the end of the day. VMware’s sales cycles are slow – there’s just one big release every year, so they don't need to find people who are willing to work really long hours or people whose job is to make sure that the build tool chain is on the cutting edge (and in fact, most of their customers, who tend to be huge enterprise organizations, don't want cutting edge).\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThis is a typical recruiter call, where they’ll ask about previous experience, relevant projects, and why you’re interested in VMware. They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Technical Phone Screen\n\nThis is a 1-hour long algorithmic interview. You will likely be using [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/)\n in your technical phone screen, but tools vary from team to team.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nDepending on the role, you may have a virtual onsite or an in-person onsite. In either event they follow similar formats. The exact composition will vary not only with the team but with your seniority – if you’re a mid-level engineer they will be more focused on coding. If you’re very senior, your interview will be much more about what you’ve done in the past — your work history, your work style, technical decisions you’ve made and so on. At the highest levels, the interview will feel more like an exchange of stories rather than vetting for a specific skill.\n\nSome of your questions will invariably involve VMware-specific products and knowledge, so make sure you do some background research before heading in.‘\n\nThat said, VMware’s onsite lasts between 5 and 6 hours and consists of the following rounds:\n\n*   Coding (1 hour)\n*   (For niche roles) Domain-specific coding (1 hour)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Technical communication (1 hour)\n*   Behavioral (1 hour)\n\nThe order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that VMware’s interview process is centralized, you generally won’t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you’ll end up on.\n\n#### Coding\n\nAt minimum there will be two algorithms and data structures interviews in your onsite loop. Your interview will happen in CoderPad if it’s remote, but if it’s in person, it’ll be on a physical whiteboard.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThere will be one or two design rounds depending on your specific role and focus.\n\n#### (Potential) Hiring manage round\n\nThe main purpose of this round is to chat about your past projects and work experience, and they’re very focused on your ability to communicate technical details clearly and concisely. Try to come prepared to talk about projects that are relevant to VMware and its values.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThis call’s aim is to assess your fit for VMware and will focus heavily on the company’s values and mission.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at VMware\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### Coding\n\nCoding questions will focus on algorithms and data structures, and while the questions asked can vary depending on the role, you’ll likely see medium to hard-difficulty LeetCode style problems.\n\nTo figure out what types of questions to expect in your VMWare interviews, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former VMWare interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with our own data-set of mock interviews.

They’ll also elaborate on the role and confirm that your experience and expectations are a good match.\n\nIt’s really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a [detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1687337715912604&usg=AOvVaw2DmZ7rz25IR1Q42FqB380A)\n.

The exact composition will vary not only with the team but with your seniority – if you’re a mid-level engineer they will be more focused on coding. If you’re very senior, your interview will be much more about what you’ve done in the past — your work history, your work style, technical decisions you’ve made and so on. At the highest levels, the interview will feel more like an exchange of stories rather than vetting for a specific skill.\n\nSome of your questions will invariably involve VMware-specific products and knowledge, so make sure you do some background research before heading in.‘\n\nThat said, VMware’s onsite lasts between 5 and 6 hours and consists of the following rounds:\n\n*   Coding (1 hour)\n*   (For niche roles) Domain-specific coding (1 hour)\n*   System design (1 hour)\n*   Technical communication (1 hour)\n*   Behavioral (1 hour)\n\nThe order of these rounds can vary, as well as the number of coding interviews required. Depending on your score for various portions of the onsite, you may be required to complete an extra system design, object oriented design, or algorithms interview. There may be extra rounds for certain teams and roles as well. Given that VMware’s interview process is centralized, you generally won’t be interviewing with engineers or managers from the team you’ll end up on.\n\n#### Coding\n\nAt minimum there will be two algorithms and data structures interviews in your onsite loop. Your interview will happen in CoderPad if it’s remote, but if it’s in person, it’ll be on a physical whiteboard.\n\n#### System Design\n\nThere will be one or two design rounds depending on your specific role and focus.\n\n#### (Potential) Hiring manage round\n\nThe main purpose of this round is to chat about your past projects and work experience, and they’re very focused on your ability to communicate technical details clearly and concisely. Try to come prepared to talk about projects that are relevant to VMware and its values.\n\n#### Behavioral\n\nThis call’s aim is to assess your fit for VMware and will focus heavily on the company’s values and mission.\n\nTypes of Interview Questions to Expect at VMware\n------------------------------------------------",

Based on the data collected from over 100k interviews on our platform, JavaScript emerged as the third most popular language of choice, being used in 12% of all technical interviews. JavaScript ranks just below popular programming languages like Python and Java, yet, when chosen, JavaScript delivers a pass rate of 42% in the interviews, showcasing its significance and effectiveness.\n\nBelow is a distribution of programming languages and their popularity in technical interviews as well as success rates in interviews by language.\n\n![Programming languages distribution in interviewing.io interviews. JavaScript gets used in interviews 12% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Java_Script_usage_in_interviews_2813f93d56.png)\n\n![Interview success rates, by programming language, on interviewing.io. Engineers who code in JavaScript pass interviews 42% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Java_Script_success_rate_in_interviews_babeca789d.png)\n\nOne of the reasons for JavaScript's popularity is its versatility. It works on both the backend and frontend, making it a valuable tool for full-stack developers. Using a single language across multiple layers of an application can enhance productivity and improve workflow.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be a discussion about JavaScript without acknowledging the love-hate relationship it enjoys with programmers. JavaScript can be likened to that old friend you may sometimes find eccentric and unpredictable, yet they always surprise you with their resourcefulness and charm. No matter how you feel about it, one thing is sure — you can't ignore JavaScript.\n\nWhy JavaScript is Important for Technical Interviews\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Unique Qualities of JavaScript\n\nJavaScript stands out due to its adaptability and prevalence in web development. It's a flexible tool that handles both object-oriented and functional programming styles, making it ideal for showcasing diverse problem-solving skills in interviews. Its role as the sole native language of web browsers puts it front and center in web development, offering a clear edge during interviews. Its use in front-end and back-end development, thanks to tools like Node.js and frameworks like React, makes it a full-stack developer's dream.\n\n### Industry Significance of JavaScript\n\nJavaScript's importance goes beyond its technical merits—it's also a leading language in the industry. The [2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-most-popular-technologies)\n marks it as the most commonly used language for the eleventh year in a row. [GitHub's Octoverse Report 2022](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages)\n also attests to the same fact, with JavaScript being the most used language on GitHub. This sustained industry demand ensures that JavaScript expertise remains highly valued in technical interviews.\n\nJavaScript Idioms & Idiosyncrasies\n----------------------------------\n\nJavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in just ten days in the year 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications. Over the years, JavaScript has undergone numerous changes and enhancements. ECMAScript (ES), the standardized language specification, has overseen these transformations. One of the most significant shifts came with the release of [ES6 (also known as ES2015)](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/)\n in June 2015, which introduced new syntax and powerful features that transformed the way JavaScript code was written. Since then, new versions of the specification have been released yearly, with the latest being [ES2023](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)\n.\n\nWhile the specifications have evolved, JavaScript's core principles have remained unchanged. It's a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative programming styles. Additionally, it's a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous language that uses an event loop to handle concurrency. In recent years, the emergence of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n - a statically typed superset of JavaScript - highlights the evolving nature of JavaScript, offering type safety and improved tooling. In this section we'll learn about JavaScript's idioms and idiosyncrasies, that make it special.\n\n### Single Threaded Event Loop & Asynchronous Behavior\n\nJavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can process one operation at a time in a single sequence, or thread, of operations. While this might seem limiting, especially considering that many programming languages use multi-threading, JavaScript leverages this single-threaded nature using an event loop mechanism to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.\n\nJavaScript's single-threaded nature helps it avoid the complexities of multithreading while manipulating [DOM tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)\n, making it easier to learn and use. But since it can only process one operation at a time, a long-running operation can block the thread and hang the system, causing what is known as a \"blocking\" operation.\n\nTo overcome this, JavaScript uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It utilizes an [event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Event_loop)\n and a callback queue. When an asynchronous operation is encountered, it's offloaded to the browser's Web APIs, freeing up the main thread to continue executing other operations. The associated callback function is pushed into a task queue when the asynchronous operation is completed. The event loop continually checks this queue and pushes any waiting callbacks back onto the main thread for execution as soon as it's free.\n\nThis unique design allows JavaScript to handle high I/O workloads efficiently without the complexity and potential issues of multi-threading, making it particularly well-suited for web development, where asynchronous operations like network requests, user interactions, and timers are common.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    console.log(\"Fetching data...\");\n    \n    setTimeout(function() {\n      console.log(\"Data fetch complete!\");\n    }, 2000);\n    \n    console.log(\"Waiting for data...\"); \n    \n    // Output: \n    // Fetching data...\n    // Waiting for data...\n    // Data fetch complete!\n    \n\n    1console.log(\"Fetching data...\");\n    2\n    3setTimeout(function() {\n    4  console.log(\"Data fetch complete!\");\n    5}, 2000);\n    6\n    7console.log(\"Waiting for data...\"); \n    8\n    9// Output: \n    10// Fetching data...\n    11// Waiting for data...\n    12// Data fetch complete!\n    13\n\n### JavaScript Execution Environment\n\nThe environments in which JavaScript runs, such as web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.) or servers (Node.js, Deno, Bun, etc.), each provide unique features and behaviors. Although ECMAScript defines the standard specifications for JavaScript, not all environments implement these uniformly, leading to environment-specific quirks. For instance, a feature like the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)\n, widely supported in modern web browsers, wasn't natively supported in Node.js until version 17.5 ([with experimental flag](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/1737)\n). Therefore, [understanding your JavaScript execution environment](https://caniuse.com/)\n and its specific features is crucial for creating robust, cross-compatible code.\n\n### Type Coercion\n\nAs a [weakly typed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing#Definitions_of_%22strong%22_or_%22weak%22)\n, JavaScript can automatically convert values from one type to another, a behavior known as type coercion.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    console.log(4 + \"2\"); // Output: \"42\"\n    \n    let numStr = \"42\";\n    let num = +numStr; // '+' operator triggers type coercion.\n    console.log(num); // Output: 42 (a number, not a string)\n    \n\n    1console.log(4 + \"2\"); // Output: \"42\"\n    2\n    3let numStr = \"42\";\n    4let num = +numStr; // '+' operator triggers type coercion.\n    5console.log(num); // Output: 42 (a number, not a string)\n    6\n\nThis behavior of JavaScript may remind you of type casting seen in other languages. The key difference is that type casting (or type conversion) is explicitly done by the programmer, while type coercion is performed implicitly by the language. In JavaScript, it's important to understand when and how type coercion occurs to prevent unexpected outcomes.\n\n### Function Expressions\n\nJavaScript treats functions as first-class objects so that they can be assigned to variables, stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from other functions.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    // function gets assigned to a variable\n    let calculateArea = function(radius) {\n      return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n    };\n\n    1// function gets assigned to a variable\n    2let calculateArea = function(radius) {\n    3  return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n    4};\n\n### Hoisting\n\nHoisting is a unique behavior of JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the [compilation phase](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/ch1.md#required-two-phases)\n before the code has been executed.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    greet(); // Output: Hello, Interviewing.io!\n    \n    // Function declaration\n    function greet() {\n      console.log('Hello, Interviewing.io!');\n    }\n\n    1greet(); // Output: Hello, Interviewing.io!\n    2\n    3// Function declaration\n    4function greet() {\n    5  console.log('Hello, Interviewing.io!');\n    6}\n\n### Closure\n\nA closure is a function that has access to the variables of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. This is possible because the inner function has access to the outer function's scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. This helps create [private variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures#emulating_private_methods_with_closures)\n and [function factories](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures#closure)\n.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    function outerFunc() {\n      let outerVar = 'I am outside!';\n      function innerFunc() {\n        console.log(outerVar); \n      }\n      return innerFunc;\n    }\n    let inner = outerFunc();\n    inner(); // Output: I am outside!\n\n    1function outerFunc() {\n    2  let outerVar = 'I am outside!';\n    3  function innerFunc() {\n    4    console.log(outerVar); \n    5  }\n    6  return innerFunc;\n    7}\n    8let inner = outerFunc();\n    9inner(); // Output: I am outside!\n\n### The `this` Keyword\n\nIn JavaScript, `this` is a special keyword that refers to the context in which a function is called. This can vary depending on how and where the function is invoked. In a method of an object, `this` refers to the object itself. In a simple function call, `this` refers to the global object (in [non-strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode)\n) or is `undefined` (in [strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)\n).\n\nJavaScript\n\n    const myObj = {\n      value: 'Hello, World!',\n      printValue: function() {\n        console.log(this.value);\n      }\n    };\n    \n    myObj.printValue(); // Output: Hello, World!\n\n    1const myObj = {\n    2  value: 'Hello, World!',\n    3  printValue: function() {\n    4    console.log(this.value);\n    5  }\n    6};\n    7\n    8myObj.printValue(); // Output: Hello, World!\n\nContrast this with [Python](https://interviewing.io/python-interview-questions)\n, where the object context is passed explicitly as a parameter (`self`) to an instance method, and with [Java](https://interviewing.io/java-interview-questions)\n, where `this` always refers to the current instance of the class.\n\nUnderstanding the `this` keyword, and its context-dependent nature, is crucial for writing and debugging JavaScript code. It’s also a source of frequent mistakes. We'll learn more about that in the [next section](https://interviewing.io/javascript-interview-questions#improper-use-of-this-keyword)\n.\n\n### Destructuring\n\nIntroduced in ES6, destructuring allows for quickly unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects. This can help simplify code and make it more readable.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    let candidate = {\n      name: \"Alice\",\n      language: \"JavaScript\",\n      experience: \"3 years\",\n    };\n    \n    let { name, experience } = candidate;\n    console.log(name, experience); // Output: Alice, 3 years\n\n    1let candidate = {\n    2  name: \"Alice\",\n    3  language: \"JavaScript\",\n    4  experience: \"3 years\",\n    5};\n    6\n    7let { name, experience } = candidate;\n    8console.log(name, experience); // Output: Alice, 3 years\n\n### Rest and Spread Operators\n\nThese operators provide convenient ways to handle collections of items and can often simplify the code written in an interview.\n\n_Spread_: While destructuring 'unpacks' elements from an array or properties from an object, the spread operator takes it further by allowing you to expand or 'spread out' these elements or properties in a new context. It's helpful when you want to combine arrays or to use an array's values as function arguments.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    let candidate = {\n      name: \"Alice\",\n      basicSkills: [\"HTML\", \"CSS\"]\n    };\n    \n    let updatedCandidate = {\n      ...candidate, // Using spread operator to copy properties from candidate object\n      advancedSkills: [\"JavaScript\", \"React\"]\n    };\n    \n    console.log(updatedCandidate);\n    /* Output:\n    {\n      name: \"Alice\",\n      basicSkills: [\"HTML\", \"CSS\"],\n      advancedSkills: [\"JavaScript\", \"React\"]\n    }\n    */\n\n    1let candidate = {\n    2  name: \"Alice\",\n    3  basicSkills: [\"HTML\", \"CSS\"]\n    4};\n    5\n    6let updatedCandidate = {\n    7  ...candidate, // Using spread operator to copy properties from candidate object\n    8  advancedSkills: [\"JavaScript\", \"React\"]\n    9};\n    10\n    11console.log(updatedCandidate);\n    12/* Output:\n    13{\n    14  name: \"Alice\",\n    15  basicSkills: [\"HTML\", \"CSS\"],\n    16  advancedSkills: [\"JavaScript\", \"React\"]\n    17}\n    18*/\n\n_Rest_: The Rest operator collects multiple elements and condenses them into a single array. It's used in function arguments to allow the function to accept any number of parameters.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    function getCandidateDetails({ name, ...skills }) {\n      console.log(`Candidate ${name} has the following skills:`);\n      console.log(`Basic: ${skills.basicSkills}`);\n      console.log(`Advanced: ${skills.advancedSkills}`);\n    }\n    \n    getCandidateDetails(updatedCandidate);\n    /* Output:\n    Candidate Alice has the following skills:\n    Basic: HTML,CSS\n    Advanced: JavaScript,React\n    */\n\n    1function getCandidateDetails({ name, ...skills }) {\n    2  console.log(`Candidate ${name} has the following skills:`);\n    3  console.log(`Basic: ${skills.basicSkills}`);\n    4  console.log(`Advanced: ${skills.advancedSkills}`);\n    5}\n    6\n    7getCandidateDetails(updatedCandidate);\n    8/* Output:\n    9Candidate Alice has the following skills:\n    10Basic: HTML,CSS\n    11Advanced: JavaScript,React\n    12*/\n\nCommon JavaScript Interview Mistakes\n------------------------------------\n\nIn the context of interviews, a deep understanding of JavaScript is critical. There are some common pitfalls that candidates often fall into. Recognizing these mistakes can greatly enhance your interview performance and overall coding skills.\n\n### Improper Use of 'this' Keyword\n\nThe `this` keyword in JavaScript can be tricky, as its context depends on how and where it's called. Let's consider an example where you are iterating over an array of numbers to calculate their sum:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    class ArraySum {\n      constructor(numbers) {\n        this.numbers = numbers;\n        this.sum = 0;\n      }\n    \n      calculateSum() {\n        this.numbers.forEach(function(num) {\n          this.sum += num;\n        });\n      }\n    }\n    \n    let obj = new ArraySum([1, 2, 3]);\n    obj.calculateSum(); \n    console.log(obj.sum); // NaN\n    \n\n    1class ArraySum {\n    2  constructor(numbers) {\n    3    this.numbers = numbers;\n    4    this.sum = 0;\n    5  }\n    6\n    7  calculateSum() {\n    8    this.numbers.forEach(function(num) {\n    9      this.sum += num;\n    10    });\n    11  }\n    12}\n    13\n    14let obj = new ArraySum([1, 2, 3]);\n    15obj.calculateSum(); \n    16console.log(obj.sum); // NaN\n    17\n\nHere, this inside the `forEach` callback doesn't refer to the `ArraySum` instance, but to the global object (`undefined` in strict mode). This results in `NaN` because `undefined` + number in JavaScript is `NaN`.\n\nThe issue can be fixed using an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)\n:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    class ArraySum {\n      constructor(numbers) {\n        this.numbers = numbers;\n        this.sum = 0;\n      }\n    \n      calculateSum() {\n        this.numbers.forEach(num => {\n          this.sum += num;\n        });\n      }\n    }\n    \n    let obj = new ArraySum([1, 2, 3]);\n    obj.calculateSum(); \n    console.log(obj.sum); // 6\n\n    1class ArraySum {\n    2  constructor(numbers) {\n    3    this.numbers = numbers;\n    4    this.sum = 0;\n    5  }\n    6\n    7  calculateSum() {\n    8    this.numbers.forEach(num => {\n    9      this.sum += num;\n    10    });\n    11  }\n    12}\n    13\n    14let obj = new ArraySum([1, 2, 3]);\n    15obj.calculateSum(); \n    16console.log(obj.sum); // 6\n\nThe arrow function doesn't have its own `this` context, it inherits it from the surrounding code. Now `this` within the `forEach` callback correctly refers to the `ArraySum` instance, leading to the correct sum of numbers.\n\n### Using Array as a Queue without Time Complexity Considerations\n\nJavaScript has no built-in queue data structure. Using [an array as a queue](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions#using-an-array-like-a-queue-and-popping-from-the-front)\n is common during data structure and algorithm questions. However, it can be computationally expensive. Suppose you're implementing a [Breadth-First Search](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n (BFS) on a graph in an interview; you might use an array as a queue to hold nodes:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    function bfs(graph, startNode) {\n      let queue = [];\n      // enqueue operation\n      queue.push(startNode);\n      \n      while(queue.length > 0) {\n        // dequeue operation, O(n)\n        let node = queue.shift();\n        console.log(node.value);\n        \n        for(let child of node.children) {\n          queue.push(child);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    1function bfs(graph, startNode) {\n    2  let queue = [];\n    3  // enqueue operation\n    4  queue.push(startNode);\n    5  \n    6  while(queue.length > 0) {\n    7    // dequeue operation, O(n)\n    8    let node = queue.shift();\n    9    console.log(node.value);\n    10    \n    11    for(let child of node.children) {\n    12      queue.push(child);\n    13    }\n    14  }\n    15}\n\n[`Array.prototype.shift()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift)\n has a time complexity of `O(n)` because it re-indexes every remaining element in the array. This can be a major inefficiency for large arrays.\n\nYou should always let your interviewer know you know this limitation. If the interviewer insists, [you should be able to implement it](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions#not-knowing-how-to-implement-a-queue-from-scratch)\n using a linked list. This will give you a time complexity of `O(1)` for both enqueue and dequeue operations.\n\n### Mistakes with Type Coercion and Equality (== and ===)\n\nUnderstanding JavaScript's type coercion in comparison operations is crucial, especially when dealing with different data types. Let's look at a simple but confusing example:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    let a = '0';\n    let b = 0;\n    \n    console.log(a == b); // true\n    console.log(a === b); // false\n\n    1let a = '0';\n    2let b = 0;\n    3\n    4console.log(a == b); // true\n    5console.log(a === b); // false\n\nIn the first log statement, JavaScript coerces the string '0' to a number due to the `==` operator, resulting in true. In the second log statement, the `===` operator checks both value and type, hence '0' (string) and 0 (number) are not considered equal.\n\nAs a best practice, it is always [recommended](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#features-equality-checks)\n to use the `===` operator.\n\n### Not Writing Idiomatic JavaScript\n\nIdiomatic JavaScript means writing code that aligns with the community's accepted best practices and conventions. The following table shows some common mistakes that are not idiomatic JavaScript and how to fix them:\n\n| Non-idiomatic JavaScript | Idiomatic JavaScript | Explanation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `let x = new Array();` | `let x = [];` | Use literal notation to initialize arrays. |\n| `let y = new Object();` | `let y = {};` | Use literal notation to initialize objects. |\n| `for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { console.log(array[i]); }` | `array.forEach(element => console.log(element));` | Use `forEach` for array iteration. |\n| `if (a !== null && a !== undefined) {...}` | `if (a) {...}` | JavaScript treats `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, `\"\"` as falsy. Just use `if (a)` to check for these. |\n| `let z; if (x) { z = y; } else { z = w; }` | `let z = x ? y : w;` | Use the ternary operator for simple conditional assignment. |\n| `arr.indexOf(el) === -1` | `!arr.includes(el)` | Use `includes` to check if an array contains a specific element. |\n| `for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) { if (users[i].age > 21) { adults.push(users[i]); }}` | `let adults = users.filter(user => user.age > 21);` | Use `filter` for creating a new array with all elements that pass a test. |\n\n### Unintentionally Mutating Array or Objects\n\nJavaScript is a language where arrays and objects are mutable and are [passed by reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/518000/is-javascript-a-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value-language)\n. Therefore, any changes to the array or object inside a function will reflect outside the function as well, leading to unintentional side effects.\n\nLet's consider a simple array-based DFS approach where you're not properly managing mutations:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    let graph = {\n      'A': ['B', 'C'],\n      'B': ['A'],\n      'C': ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E'],\n      'D': ['C', 'E', 'F'],\n      'E': ['C', 'D'],\n      'F': ['D']\n    };\n    \n    let visited = [];\n    \n    function dfs(node) {\n      visited.push(node);\n      for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {\n        if (!visited.includes(neighbor)) {\n          dfs(neighbor);\n        }\n      }\n      return visited;\n    }\n    \n    let pathFromA = dfs('A'); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n    let pathFromB = dfs('B'); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n\n    1let graph = {\n    2  'A': ['B', 'C'],\n    3  'B': ['A'],\n    4  'C': ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E'],\n    5  'D': ['C', 'E', 'F'],\n    6  'E': ['C', 'D'],\n    7  'F': ['D']\n    8};\n    9\n    10let visited = [];\n    11\n    12function dfs(node) {\n    13  visited.push(node);\n    14  for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {\n    15    if (!visited.includes(neighbor)) {\n    16      dfs(neighbor);\n    17    }\n    18  }\n    19  return visited;\n    20}\n    21\n    22let pathFromA = dfs('A'); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n    23let pathFromB = dfs('B'); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n\nIn the above code, we expect `pathFromA` and `pathFromB` to be different, but since `visited` is shared and gets mutated during each `DFS` run, `pathFromB` doesn't give us the expected result.\n\nTo fix this, we need to initialize `visited` within the function itself:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    function dfs(node, visited = []) {\n      visited.push(node);\n      for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {\n        if (!visited.includes(neighbor)) {\n          dfs(neighbor, visited);\n        }\n      }\n      return visited;\n    }\n    \n    let pathFromA = dfs('A'); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n    let pathFromB = dfs('B'); // ['B', 'A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n\n    1function dfs(node, visited = []) {\n    2  visited.push(node);\n    3  for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {\n    4    if (!visited.includes(neighbor)) {\n    5      dfs(neighbor, visited);\n    6    }\n    7  }\n    8  return visited;\n    9}\n    10\n    11let pathFromA = dfs('A'); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n    12let pathFromB = dfs('B'); // ['B', 'A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n\nNow, `pathFromA` and `pathFromB` are different as expected. Understanding and managing mutations properly is crucial in JavaScript, particularly in tricky algorithms such as DFS.\n\n### Not Understanding the Sort() Method\n\nJavaScript's built-in `Array.prototype.sort()` method can be a source of confusion, especially when sorting numerical arrays. If no compare function is supplied, `sort()` will convert items to strings and sort them in lexicographic (alphabetical) order, which can lead to unexpected results when dealing with numbers.\n\nFor instance, let's say you're working on a coding problem where you're given an array of integers, and you need to sort them in ascending order. You might think you could simply use `sort()`:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    let arr = [10, 21, 4, 15];\n    arr.sort();\n    console.log(arr); // Outputs: [10, 15, 21, 4]\n\n    1let arr = [10, 21, 4, 15];\n    2arr.sort();\n    3console.log(arr); // Outputs: [10, 15, 21, 4]\n\nThis output isn't what you'd expect if you wanted to sort numerically. It's because `sort()` converts the numbers to strings, and '10' is lexicographically less than '4'.\n\nTo correctly sort numbers in JavaScript, you need to supply a comparator function:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    let arr = [10, 21, 4, 15];\n    \n    // sort method is passed a comparator function\n    // if comparator(a, b) returns a negative number, a comes before b\n    // if comparator(a, b) returns a positive number, b comes before a\n    // if comparator(a, b) returns 0, a and b are unchanged with respect to each other\n    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    \n    console.log(arr); // Outputs: [4, 10, 15, 21]\n    \n\n    1let arr = [10, 21, 4, 15];\n    2\n    3// sort method is passed a comparator function\n    4// if comparator(a, b) returns a negative number, a comes before b\n    5// if comparator(a, b) returns a positive number, b comes before a\n    6// if comparator(a, b) returns 0, a and b are unchanged with respect to each other\n    7arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    8\n    9console.log(arr); // Outputs: [4, 10, 15, 21]\n    10\n\n### Using 'var' instead of 'let' or 'const'\n\nThe use of `var` is considered outdated in modern JavaScript (ES6 and later). Instead, `let` and `const` are preferred because they provide block scoping, reducing potential bugs and making the code easier to predict and understand.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is:\n\n*   Use `const` when the variable should not be reassigned. This is often true for function declarations, imported modules, and configuration variables. Using `const` can help you catch errors where you accidentally try to reassign a variable.\n    \n*   Use `let` when the variable will be reassigned. This is common in loops (for instance, counters), and in some algorithm implementations.\n    \n\nChoosing `let` or `const` appropriately in your code makes it more predictable and signals to other developers (and interviewers) that you understand the variable's purpose and lifecycle. This can make your code easier to read and maintain.\n\nIt's also important to note that `const` does not make the entire variable immutable, only the assignment. For instance, if you declare an object or an array with `const`, you can still modify the elements in the array or the object's properties. This can lead to unintentional behavior if not fully understood.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    const obj = {};\n    obj.property = 'value'; // This is allowed\n    \n    const arr = [];\n    arr.push(1); // This is allowed\n    \n\n    1const obj = {};\n    2obj.property = 'value'; // This is allowed\n    3\n    4const arr = [];\n    5arr.push(1); // This is allowed\n    6\n\nJavaScript Interview Replays\n----------------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in JavaScript. The questions asked in these interviews tend to be language-agnostic (rather than asking about language-specific details and idiosyncrasies), but in these cases, the interviewee chose JavaScript as the language they would work in.\n\n[![Meeting hour optimization](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJavascript_Google_5_7d524c4ffc.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nMeeting hour optimization\\\n\\\nIntergalactic Avenger, a Google engineer, interviewed Stealthy Werewolf in JavaScript](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-javascript-meeting-hour-optimization)\n\n[![Longest common subsequence of two strings](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJavascript_Google_3_9df5790c4f.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nLongest common subsequence of two strings\\\n\\\nPaisley Wallaby, a Google engineer, interviewed Stealthy Dictaphone in JavaScript](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-javascript-longest-common-subsequence-of-two-strings)\n\n[![Regular expression matcher](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJavascript_Google_4_5903e6bbcd.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nRegular expression matcher\\\n\\\nPaisley Wallaby, a Google engineer, interviewed Fresh Albatross in JavaScript](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-javascript-regular-expression-matcher)\n\n[![LRU Cache](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJavascript_Pivotal_Labs_1_5adce15044.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nPivotal Labs Interviewer\\\n\\\nLRU Cache\\\n\\\nFearsome Sandwich, a Pivotal Labs engineer, interviewed Special Chameleon in JavaScript](https://interviewing.io/mocks/pivotal-labs-javascript-lru-cache)\n\n[![Memory efficient lookup](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJavascript_Google_19_a9c001d478.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nMemory efficient lookup\\\n\\\nIntergalactic Avenger, a Google engineer, interviewed Samurai Razor in JavaScript](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-javascript-memory-efficient-lookup)\n\n[![K closest points](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJavascript_Microsoft_8_879d84dde4.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nMicrosoft Interviewer\\\n\\\nK closest points\\\n\\\nIndelible Raven, a Microsoft engineer, interviewed Nimble Pumpkin in JavaScript](https://interviewing.io/mocks/microsoft-javascript-k-closest-points)\n\n[See more like this](https://interviewing.io/mocks?language=javascript)\n\n![Interview Problems](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FHeroImage.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAbout interviewing.io\n---------------------\n\ninterviewing.io is a **[mock interview practice platform](https://interviewing.io/)\n**.

          "content": "### Industry Significance of JavaScript\n\nJavaScript's importance goes beyond its technical merits—it's also a leading language in the industry. The [2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-most-popular-technologies)\n marks it as the most commonly used language for the eleventh year in a row. [GitHub's Octoverse Report 2022](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages)\n also attests to the same fact, with JavaScript being the most used language on GitHub. This sustained industry demand ensures that JavaScript expertise remains highly valued in technical interviews.\n\nJavaScript Idioms & Idiosyncrasies\n----------------------------------\n\nJavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in just ten days in the year 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications. Over the years, JavaScript has undergone numerous changes and enhancements. ECMAScript (ES), the standardized language specification, has overseen these transformations. One of the most significant shifts came with the release of [ES6 (also known as ES2015)](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/)\n in June 2015, which introduced new syntax and powerful features that transformed the way JavaScript code was written. Since then, new versions of the specification have been released yearly, with the latest being [ES2023](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)\n.\n\nWhile the specifications have evolved, JavaScript's core principles have remained unchanged. It's a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative programming styles. Additionally, it's a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous language that uses an event loop to handle concurrency. In recent years, the emergence of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n - a statically typed superset of JavaScript - highlights the evolving nature of JavaScript, offering type safety and improved tooling. In this section we'll learn about JavaScript's idioms and idiosyncrasies, that make it special.",

          "content": "### Single Threaded Event Loop & Asynchronous Behavior\n\nJavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can process one operation at a time in a single sequence, or thread, of operations. While this might seem limiting, especially considering that many programming languages use multi-threading, JavaScript leverages this single-threaded nature using an event loop mechanism to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.\n\nJavaScript's single-threaded nature helps it avoid the complexities of multithreading while manipulating [DOM tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)\n, making it easier to learn and use. But since it can only process one operation at a time, a long-running operation can block the thread and hang the system, causing what is known as a \"blocking\" operation.\n\nTo overcome this, JavaScript uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It utilizes an [event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Event_loop)\n and a callback queue. When an asynchronous operation is encountered, it's offloaded to the browser's Web APIs, freeing up the main thread to continue executing other operations. The associated callback function is pushed into a task queue when the asynchronous operation is completed. The event loop continually checks this queue and pushes any waiting callbacks back onto the main thread for execution as soon as it's free.\n\nThis unique design allows JavaScript to handle high I/O workloads efficiently without the complexity and potential issues of multi-threading, making it particularly well-suited for web development, where asynchronous operations like network requests, user interactions, and timers are common.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    console.log(\"Fetching data...\");\n    \n    setTimeout(function() {\n      console.log(\"Data fetch complete!\");\n    }, 2000);\n    \n    console.log(\"Waiting for data...\"); \n    \n    // Output: \n    // Fetching data...\n    // Waiting for data...\n    // Data fetch complete!\n    \n\n    1console.log(\"Fetching data...\");\n    2\n    3setTimeout(function() {\n    4  console.log(\"Data fetch complete!\");\n    5}, 2000);\n    6\n    7console.log(\"Waiting for data...\"); \n    8\n    9// Output: \n    10// Fetching data...\n    11// Waiting for data...\n    12// Data fetch complete!\n    13",

The key difference is that type casting (or type conversion) is explicitly done by the programmer, while type coercion is performed implicitly by the language. In JavaScript, it's important to understand when and how type coercion occurs to prevent unexpected outcomes.",

Let's consider an example where you are iterating over an array of numbers to calculate their sum:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    class ArraySum {\n      constructor(numbers) {\n        this.numbers = numbers;\n        this.sum = 0;\n      }\n    \n      calculateSum() {\n        this.numbers.forEach(function(num) {\n          this.sum += num;\n        });\n      }\n    }\n    \n    let obj = new ArraySum([1, 2, 3]);\n    obj.calculateSum(); \n    console.log(obj.sum); // NaN\n    \n\n    1class ArraySum {\n    2  constructor(numbers) {\n    3    this.numbers = numbers;\n    4    this.sum = 0;\n    5  }\n    6\n    7  calculateSum() {\n    8    this.numbers.forEach(function(num) {\n    9      this.sum += num;\n    10    });\n    11  }\n    12}\n    13\n    14let obj = new ArraySum([1, 2, 3]);\n    15obj.calculateSum(); \n    16console.log(obj.sum); // NaN\n    17\n\nHere, this inside the `forEach` callback doesn't refer to the `ArraySum` instance, but to the global object (`undefined` in strict mode). This results in `NaN` because `undefined` + number in JavaScript is `NaN`.\n\nThe issue can be fixed using an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)\n:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    class ArraySum {\n      constructor(numbers) {\n        this.numbers = numbers;\n        this.sum = 0;\n      }\n    \n      calculateSum() {\n        this.numbers.forEach(num => {\n          this.sum += num;\n        });\n      }\n    }\n    \n    let obj = new ArraySum([1, 2, 3]);\n    obj.calculateSum(); \n    console.log(obj.sum); // 6\n\n    1class ArraySum {\n    2  constructor(numbers) {\n    3    this.numbers = numbers;\n    4    this.sum = 0;\n    5  }\n    6\n    7  calculateSum() {\n    8    this.numbers.forEach(num => {\n    9      this.sum += num;\n    10    });\n    11  }\n    12}\n    13\n    14let obj = new ArraySum([1, 2, 3]);\n    15obj.calculateSum(); \n    16console.log(obj.sum); // 6\n\nThe arrow function doesn't have its own `this` context, it inherits it from the surrounding code.

If no compare function is supplied, `sort()` will convert items to strings and sort them in lexicographic (alphabetical) order, which can lead to unexpected results when dealing with numbers.\n\nFor instance, let's say you're working on a coding problem where you're given an array of integers, and you need to sort them in ascending order. You might think you could simply use `sort()`:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    let arr = [10, 21, 4, 15];\n    arr.sort();\n    console.log(arr); // Outputs: [10, 15, 21, 4]\n\n    1let arr = [10, 21, 4, 15];\n    2arr.sort();\n    3console.log(arr); // Outputs: [10, 15, 21, 4]\n\nThis output isn't what you'd expect if you wanted to sort numerically. It's because `sort()` converts the numbers to strings, and '10' is lexicographically less than '4'.\n\nTo correctly sort numbers in JavaScript, you need to supply a comparator function:\n\nJavaScript\n\n    let arr = [10, 21, 4, 15];\n    \n    // sort method is passed a comparator function\n    // if comparator(a, b) returns a negative number, a comes before b\n    // if comparator(a, b) returns a positive number, b comes before a\n    // if comparator(a, b) returns 0, a and b are unchanged with respect to each other\n    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    \n    console.log(arr); // Outputs: [4, 10, 15, 21]\n    \n\n    1let arr = [10, 21, 4, 15];\n    2\n    3// sort method is passed a comparator function\n    4// if comparator(a, b) returns a negative number, a comes before b\n    5// if comparator(a, b) returns a positive number, b comes before a\n    6// if comparator(a, b) returns 0, a and b are unchanged with respect to each other\n    7arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    8\n    9console.log(arr); // Outputs: [4, 10, 15, 21]\n    10",

          "content": "### Using 'var' instead of 'let' or 'const'\n\nThe use of `var` is considered outdated in modern JavaScript (ES6 and later). Instead, `let` and `const` are preferred because they provide block scoping, reducing potential bugs and making the code easier to predict and understand.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is:\n\n*   Use `const` when the variable should not be reassigned. This is often true for function declarations, imported modules, and configuration variables. Using `const` can help you catch errors where you accidentally try to reassign a variable.\n    \n*   Use `let` when the variable will be reassigned. This is common in loops (for instance, counters), and in some algorithm implementations.\n    \n\nChoosing `let` or `const` appropriately in your code makes it more predictable and signals to other developers (and interviewers) that you understand the variable's purpose and lifecycle. This can make your code easier to read and maintain.\n\nIt's also important to note that `const` does not make the entire variable immutable, only the assignment. For instance, if you declare an object or an array with `const`, you can still modify the elements in the array or the object's properties. This can lead to unintentional behavior if not fully understood.\n\nJavaScript\n\n    const obj = {};\n    obj.property = 'value'; // This is allowed\n    \n    const arr = [];\n    arr.push(1); // This is allowed\n    \n\n    1const obj = {};\n    2obj.property = 'value'; // This is allowed\n    3\n    4const arr = [];\n    5arr.push(1); // This is allowed\n    6\n\nJavaScript Interview Replays\n----------------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in JavaScript.

It is beloved by many developers and one of the most popular languages in the world, ranking second to JavaScript in the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer survey.\n\nWhile few aspects of Python are unique to the language, a variety of attributes that developers love and a deep toolbox of features make it an exceptional choice for a wide range of applications and projects:\n\n**Readability:** Python is one of the most readable programming languages, frequently using English or understandable keywords (`continue`, `pass`, `def`, `local`, `finally`, etc). It also requires consistent spacing in order to run without errors and largely avoids the usage of symbols, which both improve readability.\n\n**A robust standard library:** From `json` to `datetime` to `io`, Python has a deep collection of standard library modules that enables the development of a variety of application types out of the box.\n\n**An even-deeper ecosystem of non-standard modules:** NumPy (used for scientific computing and mathematics) and Pandas (used for data analysis and manipulation) lead an incredibly deep set of non-standard-library modules, followed by other libraries such as `collections`, Flask, Django and TensorFlow. All of these libraries contribute to Python’s versatility, a major aspect of its popularity.\n\n**Excellent documentation:** The official Python documentation, as well as many top libraries, have comprehensive and easy-to-understand documentation, which is appreciated by Python engineers of all levels.\n\n**List comprehensions and dict comprehensions:** Python also has an easy, approachable and compact syntax for iterating and mapping over lists. For example, in another language you may have to write something like this in order to iterate over a list of integers and multiply them by 3:\n\nPython\n\n    nums = [2, 7, 12, 32]\n    newlist = []\n    \n    for x in nums:\n      newlist.append(x * 3)\n    \n    print(newlist) # [6, 21, 36, 96)\\\n    \\\n\\\n    1nums = [2, 7, 12, 32]\\\n    2newlist = []\\\n    3\\\n    4for x in nums:\\\n    5  newlist.append(x * 3)\\\n    6\\\n    7print(newlist) # [6, 21, 36, 96)\\\n    8\\\n\\\nHowever, in Python this code can be done in one line using a list comprehension:\\\n\\\nPython\\\n\\\n    ```\\\n    nums = [2, 7, 12, 32]\\\n    newlist = [x*3 for x in nums]\\\n    print(newlist) # [6, 21, 36, 96)\\\n    ```\\\n    \\\n\\\n    1```\\\n    2nums = [2, 7, 12, 32]\\\n    3newlist = [x*3 for x in nums]\\\n    4print(newlist) # [6, 21, 36, 96)\\\n    5```\\\n    6\\\n\\\nYou can even nest list comprehensions and add `if` statements, though doing so can make the code slightly more difficult to read and quickly comprehend:\\\n\\\nPython\\\n\\\n    capital_tuples = [['Colorado', 'Denver'], ['Minnesota', 'St. Paul'], ['Massachusetts', 'Boston']]\\\n    cities_and_states_starting_with_m = [\\\n      city_or_state\\\n      for city_state_tuple in capital_tuples\\\n      for city_or_state in city_state_tuple\\\n      if city_or_state[0] == 'M'\\\n    ]\\\n    print(cities_and_states_starting_with_m) # ['Minnesota', 'Massachusetts']\\\n    \\\n\\\n    1capital_tuples = [['Colorado', 'Denver'], ['Minnesota', 'St. Paul'], ['Massachusetts', 'Boston']]\\\n    2cities_and_states_starting_with_m = [\\\n    3  city_or_state\\\n    4  for city_state_tuple in capital_tuples\\\n    5  for city_or_state in city_state_tuple\\\n    6  if city_or_state[0] == 'M'\\\n    7]\\\n    8print(cities_and_states_starting_with_m) # ['Minnesota', 'Massachusetts']\\\n    9\\\n\\\nSimilarly, you can use construct dictionaries using dict comprehensions:\\\n\\\nPython\\\n\\\n    capital_tuples = [[\"Colorado\", \"Denver\"], ['Minnesota', 'St. Paul'], ['Massachusetts', 'Boston']]\\\n    capital_dict = {state: capital for state, capital in capital_tuples}\\\n    print(capital_dict)  # { 'Colorado': 'Denver', 'Minnesota': 'St. Paul', 'Massachusetts': ‘Boston' }\\\n    \\\n\\\n    1capital_tuples = [[\"Colorado\", \"Denver\"], ['Minnesota', 'St. Paul'], ['Massachusetts', 'Boston']]\\\n    2capital_dict = {state: capital for state, capital in capital_tuples}\\\n    3print(capital_dict)  # { 'Colorado': 'Denver', 'Minnesota': 'St. Paul', 'Massachusetts': ‘Boston' }\\\n    4\\\n\\\n**Lambda expressions / lambda functions:** Lambda expressions are anonymous, simple functions in Python often used within high-order functions such as `filter` or `map`. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression and semantically they are simply syntactic sugar for a normal function definition.\\\n\\\nPython\\\n\\\n    nums = [2, 7, 12, 17, 23]\\\n    odd_nums = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, nums))\\\n    print(odd_nums)\\\n    \\\n    nums_squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))\\\n    print(nums_squared)\\\n    \\\n\\\n    1nums = [2, 7, 12, 17, 23]\\\n    2odd_nums = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, nums))\\\n    3print(odd_nums)\\\n    4\\\n    5nums_squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))\\\n    6print(nums_squared)\\\n    7\\\n\\\nPython Interview Stats\\\n----------------------\\\n\\\nWe've hosted over 100k interviews on our platform. Python was the language of choice in those interviews 40% of the time, and engineers who interviewed in Python passed their interviews 56% of the time.\\\n\\\nBelow is a distribution of programming languages and their popularity in technical interviews as well as success rates in interviews, by language.\\\n\\\n![Python usage in interviews](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Python_usage_in_interviews_a22d64f2ed.png)\\\n\\\n![Python success rate in interviews.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Python_success_rate_in_interviews_368a100613.png)\\\n\\\nCommon Python Interview Mistakes\\\n--------------------------------\\\n\\\nThough Python is known for being easy to understand, debug and reason about, there are a handful of quirks that may throw off newer developers or developers coming from other languages:\\\n\\\n**Spacing matters**: While strict spacing rules makes Python code more readable, it also won’t run properly without consistent spacing. For example, many languages use brackets (`{` and `}`) to denote the beginning and ending of code blocks or functions, but Python relies on indentation and colons.\\\n\\\n**Scope and closures:** In many languages you can automatically reference variables in the enclosing scope (or other outer scopes), but in Python you can only reference local variables. In order to access variables in an outer scope the `nonlocal` keyword is required, and in order to reference variables in the global scope the (you guessed it) `global` keyword is required.\\\n\\\nPython\\\n\\\n    # Global variable\\\n    global_var = 10\\\n    \\\n    def outer_function():\\\n        # Outer function variable\\\n        outer_var = 20\\\n    \\\n        def inner_function():\\\n            # Local variable\\\n            inner_var = 30\\\n    \\\n            print(\"Local variable:\", inner_var) # 30\\\n            nonlocal outer_var\\\n            outer_var = 40\\\n            print(\"Nonlocal variable:\", outer_var) # 40\\\n            global global_var\\\n            global_var = 50\\\n            print(\"Global variable:\", global_var) # 50\\\n    \\\n        print(\"Outer variable:\", outer_var) # 20\\\n        inner_function()\\\n    \\\n    outer_function()\\\n    \\\n\\\n    1# Global variable\\\n    2global_var = 10\\\n    3\\\n    4def outer_function():\\\n    5    # Outer function variable\\\n    6    outer_var = 20\\\n    7\\\n    8    def inner_function():\\\n    9        # Local variable\\\n    10        inner_var = 30\\\n    11\\\n    12        print(\"Local variable:\", inner_var) # 30\\\n    13        nonlocal outer_var\\\n    14        outer_var = 40\\\n    15        print(\"Nonlocal variable:\", outer_var) # 40\\\n    16        global global_var\\\n    17        global_var = 50\\\n    18        print(\"Global variable:\", global_var) # 50\\\n    19\\\n    20    print(\"Outer variable:\", outer_var) # 20\\\n    21    inner_function()\\\n    22\\\n    23outer_function()\\\n    24\\\n\\\n**Interpreted:** Python is an interpreted language, meaning errors surface at run-time; as opposed to compiled languages such as Java, where errors surface at compile time.\\\n\\\nPython Interview Replays\\\n------------------------\\\n\\\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in Python.

[Get started](https://interviewing.io/signup) Python Interview Questions & Tips ================================= By Tom Wagner | Published: What Makes Python Unique? ------------------------- Python is an interpreted, object-oriented general-purpose programming language. It is beloved by many developers and one of the most popular languages in the world, ranking second to JavaScript in the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer survey. While few aspects of Python are unique to the language, a variety of attributes that developers love and a deep toolbox of features make it an exceptional choice for a wide range of applications and projects: **Readability:** Python is one of the most readable programming languages, frequently using English or understandable keywords (`continue`, `pass`, `def`, `local`, `finally`, etc). It also requires consistent spacing in order to run without errors and largely avoids the usage of symbols, which both improve readability. **A robust standard library:** From `json` to `datetime` to `io`, Python has a deep collection of standard library modules that enables the development of a variety of application types out of the box. **An even-deeper ecosystem of non-standard modules:** NumPy (used for scientific computing and mathematics) and Pandas (used for data analysis and manipulation) lead an incredibly deep set of non-standard-library modules, followed by other libraries such as `collections`, Flask, Django and TensorFlow. All of these libraries contribute to Python’s versatility, a major aspect of its popularity. **Excellent documentation:** The official Python documentation, as well as many top libraries, have comprehensive and easy-to-understand documentation, which is appreciated by Python engineers of all levels. **List comprehensions and dict comprehensions:** Python also has an easy, approachable and compact syntax for iterating and mapping over lists. For example, in another language you may have to write something like this in order to iterate over a list of integers and multiply them by 3: Python nums = [2, 7, 12, 32] newlist = [] for x in nums: newlist.append(x * 3) print(newlist) # [6, 21, 36, 96)\\ \\ \\ 1nums = [2, 7, 12, 32]\\ 2newlist = []\\ 3\\ 4for x in nums:\\ 5 newlist.append(x * 3)\\ 6\\ 7print(newlist) # [6, 21, 36, 96)\\ 8\\ \\ However, in Python this code can be done in one line using a list comprehension:\\ \\ Python\\ \\ ```\\ nums = [2, 7, 12, 32]\\ newlist = [x*3 for x in nums]\\ print(newlist) # [6, 21, 36, 96)\\ ```\\ \\ \\ 1```\\ 2nums = [2, 7, 12, 32]\\ 3newlist = [x*3 for x in nums]\\ 4print(newlist) # [6, 21, 36, 96)\\ 5```\\ 6\\ \\ You can even nest list comprehensions and add `if` statements, though doing so can make the code slightly more difficult to read and quickly comprehend:\\ \\ Python\\ \\ capital_tuples = [['Colorado', 'Denver'], ['Minnesota', 'St. Paul'], ['Massachusetts', 'Boston']]\\ cities_and_states_starting_with_m = [\\ city_or_state\\ for city_state_tuple in capital_tuples\\ for city_or_state in city_state_tuple\\ if city_or_state[0] == 'M'\\ ]\\ print(cities_and_states_starting_with_m) # ['Minnesota', 'Massachusetts']\\ \\ \\ 1capital_tuples = [['Colorado', 'Denver'], ['Minnesota', 'St. Paul'], ['Massachusetts', 'Boston']]\\ 2cities_and_states_starting_with_m = [\\ 3 city_or_state\\ 4 for city_state_tuple in capital_tuples\\ 5 for city_or_state in city_state_tuple\\ 6 if city_or_state[0] == 'M'\\ 7]\\ 8print(cities_and_states_starting_with_m) # ['Minnesota', 'Massachusetts']\\ 9\\ \\ Similarly, you can use construct dictionaries using dict comprehensions:\\ \\ Python\\ \\ capital_tuples = [[\"Colorado\", \"Denver\"], ['Minnesota', 'St. Paul'], ['Massachusetts', 'Boston']]\\ capital_dict = {state: capital for state, capital in capital_tuples}\\ print(capital_dict) # { 'Colorado': 'Denver', 'Minnesota': 'St. Paul', 'Massachusetts': ‘Boston' }\\ \\ \\ 1capital_tuples = [[\"Colorado\", \"Denver\"], ['Minnesota', 'St. Paul'], ['Massachusetts', 'Boston']]\\ 2capital_dict = {state: capital for state, capital in capital_tuples}\\ 3print(capital_dict) # { 'Colorado': 'Denver', 'Minnesota': 'St. Paul', 'Massachusetts': ‘Boston' }\\ 4\\ \\ **Lambda expressions / lambda functions:** Lambda expressions are anonymous, simple functions in Python often used within high-order functions such as `filter` or `map`. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression and semantically they are simply syntactic sugar for a normal function definition.\\ \\ Python\\ \\ nums = [2, 7, 12, 17, 23]\\ odd_nums = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, nums))\\ print(odd_nums)\\ \\ nums_squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))\\ print(nums_squared)\\ \\ \\ 1nums = [2, 7, 12, 17, 23]\\ 2odd_nums = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, nums))\\ 3print(odd_nums)\\ 4\\ 5nums_squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))\\ 6print(nums_squared)\\ 7\\ \\ Python Interview Stats\\ ----------------------\\ \\ We've hosted over 100k interviews on our platform. Python was the language of choice in those interviews 40% of the time, and engineers who interviewed in Python passed their interviews 56% of the time.\\ \\ Below is a distribution of programming languages and their popularity in technical interviews as well as success rates in interviews, by language.\\ \\ ![Python usage in interviews](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Python_usage_in_interviews_a22d64f2ed.png)\\ \\ ![Python success rate in interviews.png](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Python_success_rate_in_interviews_368a100613.png)\\ \\ Common Python Interview Mistakes\\ --------------------------------\\ \\ Though Python is known for being easy to understand, debug and reason about, there are a handful of quirks that may throw off newer developers or developers coming from other languages:\\ \\ **Spacing matters**: While strict spacing rules makes Python code more readable, it also won’t run properly without consistent spacing. For example, many languages use brackets (`{` and `}`) to denote the beginning and ending of code blocks or functions, but Python relies on indentation and colons.\\ \\ **Scope and closures:** In many languages you can automatically reference variables in the enclosing scope (or other outer scopes), but in Python you can only reference local variables.",

Java also had the highest success rates – engineers who chose Java as their interview language passed their interviews 51% of the time.\n\nBelow is a distribution of programming languages and their popularity in technical interviews as well as success rates in interviews, by language.\n\n![Java was the language of choice in interviewing.io interviews 29% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Java_usage_in_interviews_775a0afae7.png)\n\n![Java had a fairly low interview success rate – engineers who chose Java as their interview language on interviewing.io passed interviews just 51% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Java_success_rate_in_interviews_78098ef6da.png)\n\nJava Idioms & Idiosyncrasies\n----------------------------\n\nJava is a popular choice in software development for its portability, simplicity, and its robust, object-oriented capabilities. It's a high-level language that has a great emphasis on readability and simplicity.\n\nAs a seasoned and commonly used language, Java boasts a vast feature set and numerous libraries. It’s a language that enforces strict typing and has an extensive standard library. It’s a language and culture with a significant amount of formalism, especially regarding object-oriented programming and type systems.\n\nMost candidates and interviewers will be familiar with Java’s class structure, inheritance rules, and other internals. Focus on the core parts of what make Java great and express your solutions in with good Object-Oriented styles.\n\n*   **Classes and Objects**: Java is a fully object-oriented language. Ensure you're comfortable with classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.\n*   **Exception Handling**: Java has a robust exception handling mechanism with try, catch, finally, and throw blocks. Understand the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.\n*   **Java Collections Framework**: Java provides a rich set of prepackaged data structures and algorithms called the Java Collections Framework. Be comfortable with common collections like List, Set, Map, Queue, etc.\n*   **Generics**: Generics provide compile-time type safety that allows programmers to catch invalid types at compile time.\n*   **Concurrency**: Understand the basics of multi-threading, synchronization, and the Java concurrency utilities from the java.util.concurrent package.\n*   **Stream API**: Java 8 introduced the Stream API for functional-style operations on streams of elements. It is beneficial to understand how to use streams for operations like filtering, mapping, or collecting elements to a result container.\n*   **Java Memory Model**: Understand how memory allocation works in Java, including the role of the garbage collector.\n\nCommon Java Interview Mistakes\n------------------------------\n\nWhen interviewing in Java, there are a few common pitfalls to avoid.\n\n### Ignoring Exceptions\n\nJava's exception handling capabilities are one of its strong points, offering developers a structured way to predict, catch, and handle errors during the execution of the program. These mechanisms consist of try, catch, and finally blocks, as well as throws clauses. Yet, despite the robustness of these features, mishandling exceptions can lead to code that is not only faulty but also difficult to debug and maintain.\n\nOne common mistake is ignoring or \"swallowing\" exceptions. This refers to the practice of catching an exception but not handling it appropriately, typically leaving the catch block empty. This can be problematic as it hides error symptoms that could be critical for diagnosing issues. Swallowing exceptions is especially perilous when it's done at the system's higher levels, which could result in an entire chain of operations failing silently.\n\nFor instance, consider the following piece of code:\n\nJava\n\n    try {\n        int result = 10 / 0; // This line will throw an ArithmeticException\n    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n        // This is an example of swallowing an exception\n    }\n\n    1try {\n    2    int result = 10 / 0; // This line will throw an ArithmeticException\n    3} catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n    4    // This is an example of swallowing an exception\n    5}\n\nIn the above example, an ArithmeticException is thrown due to division by zero, but the exception is swallowed in the catch block, leading to a silent failure. This kind of error can be incredibly difficult to track down in a larger codebase because it leaves no trace.\n\nA better practice would be to at least log the exception, giving you a chance to diagnose the problem if something goes wrong. Here's how you might handle the exception more effectively:\n\nJava\n\n    try {\n        int result = 10 / 0; // This line will throw an ArithmeticException\n    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"An arithmetic error occurred: \" + e.getMessage());\n    }\n\n    1try {\n    2    int result = 10 / 0; // This line will throw an ArithmeticException\n    3} catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n    4    System.err.println(\"An arithmetic error occurred: \" + e.getMessage());\n    5}\n\nBy appropriately logging the exception, you will get a message in your error log indicating what went wrong, making it easier to debug and fix the issue. In real-world applications, you'd likely use a logging framework like [Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/)\n or [SLF4J](https://slf4j.org/)\ninstead of System.err.println, but the principle remains the same.\n\nRemember, ignoring exceptions may result in unpredictable behavior, while proper exception handling leads to more robust, reliable, and maintainable software.\n\n### Neglecting Null Checks\n\nJava's object-oriented paradigm permits the use of null references, i.e., references that do not point to any object. While null references can be handy, they also pose a common pitfall: a `NullPointerException` (NPE). This exception is thrown when a program attempts to use an object reference that has the null value. These include calling an instance method on the object referred to by the null reference or trying to access a field of the object. Forgetting to check for null before accessing object methods or properties is a common oversight that can lead to such crashes.\n\nTake, for example, the following code:\n\nJava\n\n    String myString = null;\n    int length = myString.length(); // This will throw a NullPointerException\n\n    1String myString = null;\n    2int length = myString.length(); // This will throw a NullPointerException\n\nIn this scenario, `myString` is `null`, and calling `length()` on it results in a `NullPointerException`. This mistake can be easy to overlook in complex codebases or when dealing with returned values from methods, or objects that have many fields in them, leading to program failure.\n\nA good defensive programming practice is to make null checks before accessing methods or properties of an object. Modifying the previous example, we would have:\n\nJava\n\n    String myString = null;\n    int length = 0;\n    if (myString != null) {\n        length = myString.length(); // Safe!\n    }\n\n    1String myString = null;\n    2int length = 0;\n    3if (myString != null) {\n    4    length = myString.length(); // Safe!\n    5}\n\nIn this case, we only attempt to call the `length()` method if `myString` is not `null`, thereby avoiding the potential for a `NullPointerException`.\n\nMoreover, as of Java 8, the `Optional` class was introduced to help deal with null references in a more explicit and safer manner. Using `Optional` can help you design more robust APIs by making the potential absence of a value explicit in your method signatures and forcing the caller to consider the null case. Here's an example of that :\n\nJava\n\n    Optional<String> myOptionalString = Optional.ofNullable(null);\n    int length = myOptionalString.map(String::length).orElse(0);\n\n    1Optional<String> myOptionalString = Optional.ofNullable(null);\n    2int length = myOptionalString.map(String::length).orElse(0);\n\nIn this example, we wrap the potentially null string in an `Optional`. `Optional.ofNullable` is used to create an `Optional` that will either hold a non-null value or be empty if the provided value is null. Then, we use the map function to apply the length method only if the `Optional` is not empty. If the `Optional` is empty, which means the original string was `null`, the `orElse` method will be used to provide a default value of `0`.\n\nWhile null references cannot always be avoided, careful checks, liberal use of `Optional`, and thoughtful API design can prevent many common `NullPointerExceptions`, leading to more robust and error-resilient programs.\n\n### Improper Usage of equals() and hashCode()\n\nJava's Object class, from which all other classes inherit, includes `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods. When you create custom classes in Java, you may need to override these methods, particularly if you're going to use instances of these classes as keys in a `HashMap` or inside a `Set`. Not doing so may lead to unexpected results.\n\nThe `equals()` method checks if two objects are equal at a logical level. By default, this method checks for reference equality, meaning it returns true only if the two references being compared point to the same object in memory. In many cases, you'll want to change this behavior to check for logical equality instead.\n\nFor example, consider a `Interviewer` class where equality should be determined by a interviewer's unique ID:\n\nJava\n\n    public class Interviewer {\n        private String id;\n        private String name;\n    \n        public Interviewer(String id, String name) {\n            this.id = id;\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n    \n        // Incorrect: uses reference equality, not logical equality\n        // This equals method is inherited from the Object class\n        //     // public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n        //     return this == obj;\n        // }\n    \n        // Correct: checks for logical equality using the unique ID\n        @Override\n        public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n            if (this == obj)\n                return true;\n            if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass())\n                return false;\n            Interviewer interviewer = (Interviewer) obj;\n            return id.equals(interviewer.id);    \n        }\n    }\n\n    1public class Interviewer {\n    2    private String id;\n    3    private String name;\n    4\n    5    public Interviewer(String id, String name) {\n    6        this.id = id;\n    7        this.name = name;\n    8    }\n    9\n    10    // Incorrect: uses reference equality, not logical equality\n    11    // This equals method is inherited from the Object class\n    12    //     // public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    13    //     return this == obj;\n    14    // }\n    15\n    16    // Correct: checks for logical equality using the unique ID\n    17    @Override\n    18    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    19        if (this == obj)\n    20            return true;\n    21        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass())\n    22            return false;\n    23        Interviewer interviewer = (Interviewer) obj;\n    24        return id.equals(interviewer.id);    \n    25    }\n    26}\n\nThe `hashCode()` method, on the other hand, is used in collections like `HashMap` and `HashSet` for efficient data access. It should be overridden in such a way that if two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, their `hashCode()` method should return the same value. If it doesn't, this can lead to unexpected and incorrect behavior when using these objects in collections.\n\nContinuing the Interviewer class example:\n\nJava\n\n        // Incorrect: does not override hashCode(), so it\n        // uses the default one from Object class\n        // which is not consistent with the overridden equals method\n        // @Override\n        // public int hashCode() {\n        //    return super.hashCode();\n        // }\n    \n        // Correct: hashCode() is consistent with equals()\n        @Override\n        public int hashCode() {\n            return id.hashCode();\n        }\n\n    1    // Incorrect: does not override hashCode(), so it\n    2    // uses the default one from Object class\n    3    // which is not consistent with the overridden equals method\n    4    // @Override\n    5    // public int hashCode() {\n    6    //    return super.hashCode();\n    7    // }\n    8\n    9    // Correct: hashCode() is consistent with equals()\n    10    @Override\n    11    public int hashCode() {\n    12        return id.hashCode();\n    13    }\n\nBy properly overriding `equals()` and `hashCode()`, you can ensure that your custom objects behave as expected when used in collections or when compared using `equals()`. Remember, when overriding one, you should override both. Otherwise, you might end up with hard-to-detect bugs and unexpected behavior.\n\n### Overcomplicating Solutions\n\nJava offers various features, such as streams and optional. However, overuse can lead to unnecessarily complicated and hard-to-read code. In interviews, prioritize simplicity and readability over clever, complex solutions.\n\nFor example, a complex chain of stream operations might seem like a clever way to solve a problem in a single line. Still, it could also end up being confusing to the interviewer who's trying to follow your logic. Similarly, while we discuss the usefulness of `Optional` in the point above, excessive usage of `Optional` might clutter your code, making it harder to understand and maintain.\n\nIn a coding interview, your primary goal is to convey your problem-solving skills effectively. Your solutions should be easy to understand, correct, and efficient. Prioritize simplicity and readability over using advanced language features to create clever but complicated solutions. An interviewer will be more impressed by your ability to write clean, straightforward code that solves the problem efficiently, rather than a convoluted solution that makes heavy use of advanced language features.\n\nTherefore, while it's beneficial to be familiar with advanced features in Java, it's crucial to use them judiciously and in a way that enhances, not obscures, your code's readability and simplicity.\n\nHow to Demonstrate Java Expertise in Interviews\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nTo show off your Java expertise, you could delve deep into some of the core ideas behind the Java language, such as the JVM and memory management, or discuss the latest features in the recent JDK releases. Mention garbage collection where appropriate and be sure to use Java slang like describing objects as POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).\n\nTalk about how Java has evolved over the years and how the introduction of new features like lambda expressions, the Stream API, and the module system have changed the way you code in Java. If you've adopted a more functional style with these features or even have dabbled with Kotlin then it could be worth mentioning.\n\nRemember to also follow Java best practices, such as preferring immutability, avoiding raw type usage, leveraging the enhanced for loop and try-with-resources statement, and properly overriding equals and hashCode when necessary.\n\nDemonstrating your understanding of Java best practices and idioms is crucial to succeed in Java interviews. Don't get lost in niche Java trivia and focus on showing that you can code and not how to solve a problem without involving a whole ton of extra bells and whistles.\n\nJava Interview Replays\n----------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in Java. The questions asked in these interviews tend to be language-agnostic (rather than asking about language-specific details and idiosyncrasies), but in these cases, the interviewee chose Java as the language they would work in.\n\n[![Order statistic of an unsorted array](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Google_1_ccbdbea656.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nOrder statistic of an unsorted array\\\n\\\nIntergalactic Avenger, a Google engineer, interviewed Supersonic Taco in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-java-order-statistic-of-an-unsorted-array)\n\n[![Most frequent integer and pairs of integers sum](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Google_13_dc9120cc0e.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nMost frequent integer and pairs of integers sum\\\n\\\nPaisley Wallaby, a Google engineer, interviewed Propitious Bear in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-java-most-frequent-integer-and-pairs-of-integers-sum)\n\n[![Sleep sort](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Square_2_08692ecf13.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nBlock/Square Interviewer\\\n\\\nSleep sort\\\n\\\nEponymous Squirrel, a Block/Square engineer, interviewed The Phenomenal Lemur in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/square-java-sleep-sort)\n\n[![Even palindrome generator](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Spotify_1_f56b84ca13.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nSpotify Interviewer\\\n\\\nEven palindrome generator\\\n\\\nThe Benevolent Enigma, a Spotify engineer, interviewed Spasmodic Donut in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/spotify-java-even-palindrome-generator)\n\n[![Infinite binary print](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Facebook_2_6921b40979.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nMeta Interviewer\\\n\\\nInfinite binary print\\\n\\\nStateless Samurai, a Meta engineer, interviewed Purple Hurricane in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/facebook-java-infinite-binary-print)\n\n[![Max heap](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Google_16_893fe112d7.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nMax heap\\\n\\\nIntergalactic Avenger, a Google engineer, interviewed Double Pizza in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-java-max-heap)\n\n[See more like this](https://interviewing.io/mocks?language=java)\n\n![Interview Problems](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FHeroImage.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAbout interviewing.io\n---------------------\n\ninterviewing.io is a **[mock interview practice platform](https://interviewing.io/)\n**.

          "content": "### Neglecting Null Checks\n\nJava's object-oriented paradigm permits the use of null references, i.e., references that do not point to any object. While null references can be handy, they also pose a common pitfall: a `NullPointerException` (NPE). This exception is thrown when a program attempts to use an object reference that has the null value. These include calling an instance method on the object referred to by the null reference or trying to access a field of the object. Forgetting to check for null before accessing object methods or properties is a common oversight that can lead to such crashes.\n\nTake, for example, the following code:\n\nJava\n\n    String myString = null;\n    int length = myString.length(); // This will throw a NullPointerException\n\n    1String myString = null;\n    2int length = myString.length(); // This will throw a NullPointerException\n\nIn this scenario, `myString` is `null`, and calling `length()` on it results in a `NullPointerException`. This mistake can be easy to overlook in complex codebases or when dealing with returned values from methods, or objects that have many fields in them, leading to program failure.\n\nA good defensive programming practice is to make null checks before accessing methods or properties of an object. Modifying the previous example, we would have:\n\nJava\n\n    String myString = null;\n    int length = 0;\n    if (myString != null) {\n        length = myString.length(); // Safe!\n    }\n\n    1String myString = null;\n    2int length = 0;\n    3if (myString != null) {\n    4    length = myString.length(); // Safe!\n    5}\n\nIn this case, we only attempt to call the `length()` method if `myString` is not `null`, thereby avoiding the potential for a `NullPointerException`.\n\nMoreover, as of Java 8, the `Optional` class was introduced to help deal with null references in a more explicit and safer manner. Using `Optional` can help you design more robust APIs by making the potential absence of a value explicit in your method signatures and forcing the caller to consider the null case. Here's an example of that :\n\nJava\n\n    Optional<String> myOptionalString = Optional.ofNullable(null);\n    int length = myOptionalString.map(String::length).orElse(0);\n\n    1Optional<String> myOptionalString = Optional.ofNullable(null);\n    2int length = myOptionalString.map(String::length).orElse(0);\n\nIn this example, we wrap the potentially null string in an `Optional`. `Optional.ofNullable` is used to create an `Optional` that will either hold a non-null value or be empty if the provided value is null. Then, we use the map function to apply the length method only if the `Optional` is not empty. If the `Optional` is empty, which means the original string was `null`, the `orElse` method will be used to provide a default value of `0`.\n\nWhile null references cannot always be avoided, careful checks, liberal use of `Optional`, and thoughtful API design can prevent many common `NullPointerExceptions`, leading to more robust and error-resilient programs.",

          "content": "### Improper Usage of equals() and hashCode()\n\nJava's Object class, from which all other classes inherit, includes `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods. When you create custom classes in Java, you may need to override these methods, particularly if you're going to use instances of these classes as keys in a `HashMap` or inside a `Set`. Not doing so may lead to unexpected results.\n\nThe `equals()` method checks if two objects are equal at a logical level. By default, this method checks for reference equality, meaning it returns true only if the two references being compared point to the same object in memory. In many cases, you'll want to change this behavior to check for logical equality instead.\n\nFor example, consider a `Interviewer` class where equality should be determined by a interviewer's unique ID:\n\nJava\n\n    public class Interviewer {\n        private String id;\n        private String name;\n    \n        public Interviewer(String id, String name) {\n            this.id = id;\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n    \n        // Incorrect: uses reference equality, not logical equality\n        // This equals method is inherited from the Object class\n        //     // public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n        //     return this == obj;\n        // }\n    \n        // Correct: checks for logical equality using the unique ID\n        @Override\n        public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n            if (this == obj)\n                return true;\n            if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass())\n                return false;\n            Interviewer interviewer = (Interviewer) obj;\n            return id.equals(interviewer.id);    \n        }\n    }\n\n    1public class Interviewer {\n    2    private String id;\n    3    private String name;\n    4\n    5    public Interviewer(String id, String name) {\n    6        this.id = id;\n    7        this.name = name;\n    8    }\n    9\n    10    // Incorrect: uses reference equality, not logical equality\n    11    // This equals method is inherited from the Object class\n    12    //     // public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    13    //     return this == obj;\n    14    // }\n    15\n    16    // Correct: checks for logical equality using the unique ID\n    17    @Override\n    18    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    19        if (this == obj)\n    20            return true;\n    21        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass())\n    22            return false;\n    23        Interviewer interviewer = (Interviewer) obj;\n    24        return id.equals(interviewer.id);    \n    25    }\n    26}\n\nThe `hashCode()` method, on the other hand, is used in collections like `HashMap` and `HashSet` for efficient data access. It should be overridden in such a way that if two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, their `hashCode()` method should return the same value. If it doesn't, this can lead to unexpected and incorrect behavior when using these objects in collections.\n\nContinuing the Interviewer class example:\n\nJava\n\n        // Incorrect: does not override hashCode(), so it\n        // uses the default one from Object class\n        // which is not consistent with the overridden equals method\n        // @Override\n        // public int hashCode() {\n        //    return super.hashCode();\n        // }\n    \n        // Correct: hashCode() is consistent with equals()\n        @Override\n        public int hashCode() {\n            return id.hashCode();\n        }\n\n    1    // Incorrect: does not override hashCode(), so it\n    2    // uses the default one from Object class\n    3    // which is not consistent with the overridden equals method\n    4    // @Override\n    5    // public int hashCode() {\n    6    //    return super.hashCode();\n    7    // }\n    8\n    9    // Correct: hashCode() is consistent with equals()\n    10    @Override\n    11    public int hashCode() {\n    12        return id.hashCode();\n    13    }\n\nBy properly overriding `equals()` and `hashCode()`, you can ensure that your custom objects behave as expected when used in collections or when compared using `equals()`. Remember, when overriding one, you should override both. Otherwise, you might end up with hard-to-detect bugs and unexpected behavior.",

          "content": "### Overcomplicating Solutions\n\nJava offers various features, such as streams and optional. However, overuse can lead to unnecessarily complicated and hard-to-read code. In interviews, prioritize simplicity and readability over clever, complex solutions.\n\nFor example, a complex chain of stream operations might seem like a clever way to solve a problem in a single line. Still, it could also end up being confusing to the interviewer who's trying to follow your logic. Similarly, while we discuss the usefulness of `Optional` in the point above, excessive usage of `Optional` might clutter your code, making it harder to understand and maintain.\n\nIn a coding interview, your primary goal is to convey your problem-solving skills effectively. Your solutions should be easy to understand, correct, and efficient. Prioritize simplicity and readability over using advanced language features to create clever but complicated solutions. An interviewer will be more impressed by your ability to write clean, straightforward code that solves the problem efficiently, rather than a convoluted solution that makes heavy use of advanced language features.\n\nTherefore, while it's beneficial to be familiar with advanced features in Java, it's crucial to use them judiciously and in a way that enhances, not obscures, your code's readability and simplicity.\n\nHow to Demonstrate Java Expertise in Interviews\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nTo show off your Java expertise, you could delve deep into some of the core ideas behind the Java language, such as the JVM and memory management, or discuss the latest features in the recent JDK releases. Mention garbage collection where appropriate and be sure to use Java slang like describing objects as POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).\n\nTalk about how Java has evolved over the years and how the introduction of new features like lambda expressions, the Stream API, and the module system have changed the way you code in Java. If you've adopted a more functional style with these features or even have dabbled with Kotlin then it could be worth mentioning.\n\nRemember to also follow Java best practices, such as preferring immutability, avoiding raw type usage, leveraging the enhanced for loop and try-with-resources statement, and properly overriding equals and hashCode when necessary.\n\nDemonstrating your understanding of Java best practices and idioms is crucial to succeed in Java interviews. Don't get lost in niche Java trivia and focus on showing that you can code and not how to solve a problem without involving a whole ton of extra bells and whistles.\n\nJava Interview Replays\n----------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in Java. The questions asked in these interviews tend to be language-agnostic (rather than asking about language-specific details and idiosyncrasies), but in these cases, the interviewee chose Java as the language they would work in.\n\n[![Order statistic of an unsorted array](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Google_1_ccbdbea656.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nOrder statistic of an unsorted array\\\n\\\nIntergalactic Avenger, a Google engineer, interviewed Supersonic Taco in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-java-order-statistic-of-an-unsorted-array)\n\n[![Most frequent integer and pairs of integers sum](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Google_13_dc9120cc0e.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nMost frequent integer and pairs of integers sum\\\n\\\nPaisley Wallaby, a Google engineer, interviewed Propitious Bear in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-java-most-frequent-integer-and-pairs-of-integers-sum)\n\n[![Sleep sort](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Square_2_08692ecf13.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nBlock/Square Interviewer\\\n\\\nSleep sort\\\n\\\nEponymous Squirrel, a Block/Square engineer, interviewed The Phenomenal Lemur in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/square-java-sleep-sort)\n\n[![Even palindrome generator](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Spotify_1_f56b84ca13.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nSpotify Interviewer\\\n\\\nEven palindrome generator\\\n\\\nThe Benevolent Enigma, a Spotify engineer, interviewed Spasmodic Donut in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/spotify-java-even-palindrome-generator)\n\n[![Infinite binary print](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Facebook_2_6921b40979.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nMeta Interviewer\\\n\\\nInfinite binary print\\\n\\\nStateless Samurai, a Meta engineer, interviewed Purple Hurricane in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/facebook-java-infinite-binary-print)\n\n[![Max heap](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Google_16_893fe112d7.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nMax heap\\\n\\\nIntergalactic Avenger, a Google engineer, interviewed Double Pizza in Java](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-java-max-heap)\n\n[See more like this](https://interviewing.io/mocks?language=java)\n\n![Interview Problems](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FHeroImage.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAbout interviewing.io\n---------------------\n\ninterviewing.io is a **[mock interview practice platform](https://interviewing.io/)\n**.

C++ was the language of choice in those interviews 9% of the time, and engineers who did their interviews in C++ passed them 58% of the time.\n\nBelow is a distribution of programming languages and their popularity in technical interviews as well as success rates in interviews, by language.\n\n![C++ was the language of choice in interviewing.io interviews 9% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/C_usage_in_interviews_5a158fca52.png)\n\n![C++ had a fairly high interview success rate – engineers who chose C++ as their interview language on interviewing.io passed interviews 58% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/C_success_rate_in_interviews_03ecb76c27.png)\n\nC++ Idioms & Idiosyncrasies\n---------------------------\n\nAs a powerful and complex language, C++ boasts a vast feature set and low-level access – but with great power comes great responsibility 🕸️. It’s a language that allows both procedural and object-oriented programming and supports generic and metaprogramming. Some amount of functional programming is even possible with the \"newer\" language features of lambdas and the `std::function` wrapper. It’s a language and culture with a fair amount of formality, especially regarding the type systems and memory management.\n\nCandidates and interviewers may vary wildly in familiarity with C++’s class structure, templates, and other internals. The most important recommendation we can make is to make sure that if you’re using C++-specific terms to describe what you’re doing, you genuinely understand what they mean. It’s not required that you know all the details for an interview – and an understanding of all formal definitions is not obligatory – but you should be careful not to overreach, and you definitely shouldn’t attempt to gloss over your explanations, as C++ interviewers often appreciate precise and rigorous explanations.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some key, idiomatic concepts you'll want to be very comfortable with:\n\n*   **Classes and Objects**: C++ is an object-oriented language. Make sure you understand classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.\n*   **Templates**: C++'s templates allow for code reuse and type safety and they are used in all modern production C++ codebases. Be comfortable with the syntax and usage of templates in classes and functions.\n*   **STL (Standard Template Library)**: C++ provides a rich set of STL components like containers, algorithms, iterators, etc. Be familiar with common containers (like vector, set, map), algorithms (like sort, find), and iterators.\n*   **Pointers and References**: Pointers and references form a fundamental part of C++. Understand the usage, difference between pointers and references, and the concept of pointer arithmetic.\n*   **Memory Management**: Manual memory management is a significant part of C++. Understand dynamic memory allocation (new, delete) and the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom.\n*   **Exception Handling**: Understand how to use try, catch, and throw keywords for exception handling in C++. Know about the standard exception class hierarchy.\n*   **Concurrency**: Be familiar with the basics of multi-threading, synchronization primitives, and the C++11 threading library.\n\nCommon C++ Interview Mistakes\n-----------------------------\n\nFirst and foremost, as with any language, you should NOT choose C++ as a way to show off if you don’t know it well. Make sure that you pick a language you are very comfortable with, have practiced interview questions with, and ideally have worked in recently (though not strictly required).\n\nOutside of that, here are some things you should try to avoid when interviewing in C++ specifically.\n\n### Mismanaging Memory\n\nC++ gives you manual control over memory. This can lead to problems if you don't manage memory correctly. For example, the following code results in a memory leak because memory allocated with `new` is never freed with `delete`:\n\nC++\n\n    \n    int main() {\n        int* ptr = new int(5); // dynamically allocate integer\n        // do some stuff\n        return 0; // ptr goes out of scope and the memory is leaked\n    }\n    \n\n    1\n    2int main() {\n    3    int* ptr = new int(5); // dynamically allocate integer\n    4    // do some stuff\n    5    return 0; // ptr goes out of scope and the memory is leaked\n    6}\n    7\n\n### Not Leveraging the Standard Template Library (STL)\n\nThe STL provides a wide range of utilities such as containers and algorithms. Not using them or using them incorrectly can lead to inefficient code. For example, consider the following code to find a value in an unsorted `std::vector`:\n\nC++\n\n    \n    int findInVector(const std::vector<int>& vec, int value) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++) {\n            if (vec[i] == value) {\n                return i;\n            }\n        }\n        return -1; // not found\n    }\n    \n\n    1\n    2int findInVector(const std::vector<int>& vec, int value) {\n    3    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++) {\n    4        if (vec[i] == value) {\n    5            return i;\n    6        }\n    7    }\n    8    return -1; // not found\n    9}\n    10\n\nWhile it is a pride point in particular C++ developers to be able to build anything from scratch, you should show the interviewer you're a truly senior engineer that also knows when this isn't appropriate. It's tempting to write everything yourself, but in this case, this could be written much more simply and efficiently using `std::find`.\n\nC++\n\n    \n    auto it = std::find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), value);\n    if (it != vec.end()) {\n        int index = std::distance(vec.begin(), it);\n    }\n    \n\n    1\n    2auto it = std::find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), value);\n    3if (it != vec.end()) {\n    4    int index = std::distance(vec.begin(), it);\n    5}\n    6\n\nWith the find method, while the implementation is similar to the code we could have written from scratch, we utilize iterators which reduce our choices of index-out-of bounds errors, we also follow best practices of code reuse rather than building something that wasn't necessary.\n\n### Overcomplicating Interviews With Advanced Features\n\nWhile C++ offers many advanced features, such as metaprogramming and operator overloading, overuse can lead to unnecessarily complex and difficult-to-read code – especially for interviews! For example, unnecessary operator overloading:\n\nC++\n\n    \n    class MySolution {\n    public:\n        MySolution(int value) : value(value) {}\n        MySolution operator+(MySolution other) {\n            // Unexpected behavior: adding 1 is not usually part of addition\n            return MySolution(value + other.value + 1);\n        }\n    private:\n        int value;\n    };\n    \n\n    1\n    2class MySolution {\n    3public:\n    4    MySolution(int value) : value(value) {}\n    5    MySolution operator+(MySolution other) {\n    6        // Unexpected behavior: adding 1 is not usually part of addition\n    7        return MySolution(value + other.value + 1);\n    8    }\n    9private:\n    10    int value;\n    11};\n    12\n\n### Ignoring Error Handling\n\nC++ has robust error handling capabilities with exceptions, but ignoring them can lead to difficult-to-debug errors. Consider a function that fails to handle a potential division by zero error:\n\nC++\n\n    \n    double divide(double numerator, double denominator) {\n        return numerator / denominator; // No error handling for division by zero\n    }\n    \n\n    1\n    2double divide(double numerator, double denominator) {\n    3    return numerator / denominator; // No error handling for division by zero\n    4}\n    5\n\nIt would be better to throw an exception when a division by zero occurs:\n\nC++\n\n    \n    double divide(double numerator, double denominator) {\n        if (denominator == 0) {\n            throw std::invalid_argument(\"Denominator cannot be zero\");\n        }\n        return numerator / denominator;\n    }\n    \n\n    1\n    2double divide(double numerator, double denominator) {\n    3    if (denominator == 0) {\n    4        throw std::invalid_argument(\"Denominator cannot be zero\");\n    5    }\n    6    return numerator / denominator;\n    7}\n    8\n\nHow to Demonstrate C++ Expertise in Interviews\n----------------------------------------------\n\nTo impress your interviewer, delve deep into some of the core ideas behind the C++ type system, memory management, and STL.\n\nMore senior engineers who are already working in C++ daily and are involved in the community can demonstrate knowledge of the latest C++ standards and advanced features. Keep in mind, however, that this demonstration of mastery is only credible if it takes place on top of a strong foundation of fundamentals that you’ve already established earlier in the interview. Otherwise, you might come off as trying to obscure things – e.g. you can't code a binary search, but you're discussing how templates might be helpful in the problem? How does that make sense?\n\nFeel free to discuss what you know of the language evolution and standards of C++. You can talk about how C++ has evolved over the years, and how the introduction of new standards (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20) has brought significant improvements and features. Discuss how some of these features have influenced your coding practices or how they have resolved some of the common problems in C++ programming.\n\nLastly, above all, use C++ best practices – even though it is an interview! You should still be doing things like avoiding raw pointers, preferring pre-built STL algorithms over hand-written loops, writing exception-safe code, using `const` correctness, and following SOLID principles.\n\nRemember, the ultimate goal is not really just to show that you know a lot about C++, but also that you can use the language effectively to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.\n\nC++ Interview Replays\n---------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in C++. The questions asked in these interviews tend to be language-agnostic (rather than asking about language-specific details and idiosyncrasies), but in these cases, the interviewee chose C++ as the language they would work in.\n\n[![Missing item list difference](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Airbnb_2_47260145b9.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nAirbnb Interviewer\\\n\\\nMissing item list difference\\\n\\\nThe Legendary Artichoke, an Airbnb engineer, interviewed Supreme Werewolf in C++](https://interviewing.io/mocks/airbnb-cplusplus-missing-item-list-difference)\n\n[![Closest coin](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Google_8_2589c4e3db.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nClosest coin\\\n\\\nIntergalactic Avenger, a Google engineer, interviewed Sergeant Koala in C++](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-c-closest-coin)\n\n[![K closest points](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Microsoft_9_b95a7d3f82.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nMicrosoft Interviewer\\\n\\\nK closest points\\\n\\\nIndelible Raven, a Microsoft engineer, interviewed Supreme Gyro in C++](https://interviewing.io/mocks/cplusplus-k-closest-points)\n\n[![K nearest points](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Microsoft_10_3819348d69.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nMicrosoft Interviewer\\\n\\\nK nearest points\\\n\\\nIndelible Raven, a Microsoft engineer, interviewed Pseudo Gyroscope in C++](https://interviewing.io/mocks/microsoft-cplusplus-k-nearest-points)\n\n[![Copy list with random pointers](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Snap_2_65608ecd94.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nSnap Interviewer\\\n\\\nCopy list with random pointers\\\n\\\nDJ Cyclone, a Snap engineer, interviewed Parallel Prism in C++](https://interviewing.io/mocks/snap-cplus-plus)\n\n[![Print linked list reverse](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FC_Snap_3_0c0955c3f8.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nSnap Interviewer\\\n\\\nPrint linked list reverse\\\n\\\nDJ Cyclone, a Snap engineer, interviewed Epic Rainbow in C++](https://interviewing.io/mocks/cplusplus-print-linked-list-reverse)\n\n[See more like this](https://interviewing.io/mocks?language=cplusplus)\n\n![Interview Problems](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FHeroImage.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAbout interviewing.io\n---------------------\n\ninterviewing.io is a **[mock interview practice platform](https://interviewing.io/)\n**.

Not using them or using them incorrectly can lead to inefficient code.

C# was the language of choice in those interviews 4% of the time. C# also had a slightly low succes rate – engineers who chose C# as their interview language passed their interviews 45% of the time.\n\nBelow is a distribution of programming languages and their popularity in technical interviews as well as success rates in interviews, by language.\n\n![C# was the language of choice in interviewing.io interviews 4% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/C_usage_in_interviews_06d080bb5d.png)\n\n![C# also had a slightly low succes rate – engineers who chose C# as their interview language passed their interviews 45% of the time.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/C_success_rate_in_interviews_9abd85aeca.png)\n\nC# Idioms & Idiosyncrasies\n--------------------------\n\nEach programming language comes with its unique set of idioms and idiosyncrasies, and C# is no different. Mastering these peculiarities is key to achieving fluency in the language and successfully navigating an interview.\n\n*   **Strongly-Typed Language**: Unlike dynamically typed languages, C# requires explicit data type declaration which helps catch errors at compile-time.\n*   **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: This powerful feature allows developers to interact with data in a type-safe, declarative manner. However, it can also lead to overuse and performance issues if not managed correctly.\n*   **Nullable Reference Types**: This feature, introduced in C# 8.0, aims to eliminate the infamous \"null reference exceptions\" by distinguishing nullable from non-nullable reference types.\n*   **Delegates and Events**: These are fundamental to the C# language and .NET framework but can be challenging to understand and use correctly.\n\nCommon C# Interview Mistakes\n----------------------------\n\nSeveral common mistakes emerge when candidates use C# during technical interviews. Here are some examples:\n\n### Poor Data Structure Choices\n\nC# provides a rich library of data structures, each with their specific usage scenarios and strengths. A common mistake is using inefficient data structures for the problem at hand. For example, using a List when a HashSet would provide a significant performance boost due to constant-time lookups.\n\nC#\n\n    // Instead of doing this...\n    List<int> myList = new List<int>();\n    \n    // When lookups are frequent, do this...\n    HashSet<int> mySet = new HashSet<int>();\n    \n\n    1// Instead of doing this...\n    2List<int> myList = new List<int>();\n    3\n    4// When lookups are frequent, do this...\n    5HashSet<int> mySet = new HashSet<int>();\n    6\n\n### Overlooking Exception Handling\n\nIt's easy to overlook exception handling during an interview, but this mistake can be a signal that the candidate isn't considering edge cases and potential failures.\n\nC#\n\n    // Neglecting try-catch-finally\n    StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(\"nonexistentfile.txt\");\n    string line = sr.ReadLine();\n    \n\n    1// Neglecting try-catch-finally\n    2StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(\"nonexistentfile.txt\");\n    3string line = sr.ReadLine();\n    4\n\n### Poor Handling of Nulls\n\nNullable types and the null coalescing operator are important tools in C#. Mistakes can happen when they are not handled correctly. This is especially critical in the recent versions of C# with nullable reference types. Using these features makes your code more concise than if/else conditionals would and makes your solution cleaner overall.\n\nC#\n\n    // Instead of this...\n    if (myObject != null) \n    {\n        myObject.DoSomething();\n    }\n    else \n    {\n        myObject = new MyObject();\n        myObject.DoSomething();\n    }\n    \n    // You can do this...\n    (myObject ??= new MyObject()).DoSomething();\n    \n\n    1// Instead of this...\n    2if (myObject != null) \n    3{\n    4    myObject.DoSomething();\n    5}\n    6else \n    7{\n    8    myObject = new MyObject();\n    9    myObject.DoSomething();\n    10}\n    11\n    12// You can do this...\n    13(myObject ??= new MyObject()).DoSomething();\n    14\n\n### Overcomplicating Solutions\n\nSometimes the simplest solution is the best. Over-engineering and making the solution more complex than it needs to be is a common mistake. Avoid adding unnecessary patterns or features that complicate the code and make it harder to read. Understand the difference between code that is meant to show you understand a concept (like in interview questions) and code that is meant to be shipped and part of a production codebase.\n\nC#\n\n    // Instead of over-complicating with design patterns...\n    IList<int> numbers = new ReadOnlyCollection<int>(new List<int> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5});\n    \n    // If all you're doing is iterating, do this...\n    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    \n\n    1// Instead of over-complicating with design patterns...\n    2IList<int> numbers = new ReadOnlyCollection<int>(new List<int> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5});\n    3\n    4// If all you're doing is iterating, do this...\n    5int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    6\n\nHow to Demonstrate C# Expertise in Interviews\n---------------------------------------------\n\n### Use C# Data Structures\n\nC# offers several structures that can make your code more efficient, such as Tuples and ValueTuples. Demonstrate your expertise by utilizing these when it makes sense.\n\nC#\n\n    public (int, int) GetMinMax(IEnumerable<int> numbers)\n    {\n        int min = numbers.Min();\n        int max = numbers.Max();\n        return (min, max);\n    }\n    \n\n    1public (int, int) GetMinMax(IEnumerable<int> numbers)\n    2{\n    3    int min = numbers.Min();\n    4    int max = numbers.Max();\n    5    return (min, max);\n    6}\n    7\n\n### Use C# Conventions and Styles\n\nAlthough this may seem minor, properly following C#'s naming and style conventions demonstrate your experience with the language. This includes things like PascalCasing public methods and properties, camelCasing private fields and parameters, using meaningful variable names, and keeping methods short and focused.\n\nC#\n\n    public class Customer\n    {\n        private string name;\n    \n        public string Name\n        {\n            get { return name; }\n            set { name = value; }\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n    1public class Customer\n    2{\n    3    private string name;\n    4\n    5    public string Name\n    6    {\n    7        get { return name; }\n    8        set { name = value; }\n    9    }\n    10}\n    11\n\nDemonstrating your C# expertise during an interview is about more than just getting the code to work. It's about showing that you understand the language deeply, and that you know how to use its features effectively and appropriately.\n\n### Effectively Use Interfaces and Abstract Classes\n\nThe ability to properly use interfaces and abstract classes is essential in C#. Show that you understand when to use which, and how they can be used to create flexible and reusable code.\n\nC#\n\n    public interface IWorker\n    {\n        void Work();\n    }\n    \n    public class Employee : IWorker\n    {\n        public void Work()\n        {\n            // Implementation here\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n    1public interface IWorker\n    2{\n    3    void Work();\n    4}\n    5\n    6public class Employee : IWorker\n    7{\n    8    public void Work()\n    9    {\n    10        // Implementation here\n    11    }\n    12}\n    13\n\n### Leverage LINQ\n\nAs mentioned earlier, LINQ is a powerful tool in C#, but many engineers fail to leverage it during their interviews. This can be due to a lack of familiarity in C# or because of the hidden time and space complexities associated with these methods. It's ok to write a solution yourself when you're not sure if the LINQ equivalent has a poor complexity, but it is better to leverage LINQ and show mastery over C# to help you with simple tasks.\n\nC#\n\n    //Instead of this...\n    List<int> nums = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n    List<int> evenNums = new List<int>();\n    \n    foreach (int num in nums)\n    {\n        if (num % 2 == 0)\n        {\n            evenNums.Add(num);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Use LINQ like this...\n    List<int> evenNums = nums.Where(num => num % 2 == 0).ToList();\n    \n\n    1//Instead of this...\n    2List<int> nums = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n    3List<int> evenNums = new List<int>();\n    4\n    5foreach (int num in nums)\n    6{\n    7    if (num % 2 == 0)\n    8    {\n    9        evenNums.Add(num);\n    10    }\n    11}\n    12\n    13// Use LINQ like this...\n    14List<int> evenNums = nums.Where(num => num % 2 == 0).ToList();\n    15\n\nLINQ should be leveraged for simple tasks that make your code more concise without sacrificing readability. Here is another example:\n\nC#\n\n    // Instead of writing a loop to find the smallest number...\n    int smallest = int.MaxValue;\n    foreach (int num in numbers)\n    {\n        if (num < smallest) smallest = num;\n    }\n    \n    // You could simply use LINQ\n    int smallest = numbers.Min();\n    \n\n    1// Instead of writing a loop to find the smallest number...\n    2int smallest = int.MaxValue;\n    3foreach (int num in numbers)\n    4{\n    5    if (num < smallest) smallest = num;\n    6}\n    7\n    8// You could simply use LINQ\n    9int smallest = numbers.Min();\n    10\n\n### Know Delegates and Events\n\nMany candidates struggle with the correct usage of delegates and events, which can lead to messy code and memory leaks. While these don't come up too often in interviews, it is worthwhile to know the ins-and-outs if you want to show mastery here.\n\nC#\n\n    // Incorrect event subscription/unsubscription\n    public delegate void Del();\n    public event Del MyEvent;\n    \n    // Somewhere in the code\n    MyEvent += SomeMethod;\n    MyEvent -= SomeMethod;  // Forgot to unsubscribe the event handler\n    \n\n    1// Incorrect event subscription/unsubscription\n    2public delegate void Del();\n    3public event Del MyEvent;\n    4\n    5// Somewhere in the code\n    6MyEvent += SomeMethod;\n    7MyEvent -= SomeMethod;  // Forgot to unsubscribe the event handler\n    8\n\nC# Interview Replays\n--------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in C#.

          "content": "### Leverage LINQ\n\nAs mentioned earlier, LINQ is a powerful tool in C#, but many engineers fail to leverage it during their interviews. This can be due to a lack of familiarity in C# or because of the hidden time and space complexities associated with these methods. It's ok to write a solution yourself when you're not sure if the LINQ equivalent has a poor complexity, but it is better to leverage LINQ and show mastery over C# to help you with simple tasks.\n\nC#\n\n    //Instead of this...\n    List<int> nums = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n    List<int> evenNums = new List<int>();\n    \n    foreach (int num in nums)\n    {\n        if (num % 2 == 0)\n        {\n            evenNums.Add(num);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Use LINQ like this...\n    List<int> evenNums = nums.Where(num => num % 2 == 0).ToList();\n    \n\n    1//Instead of this...\n    2List<int> nums = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n    3List<int> evenNums = new List<int>();\n    4\n    5foreach (int num in nums)\n    6{\n    7    if (num % 2 == 0)\n    8    {\n    9        evenNums.Add(num);\n    10    }\n    11}\n    12\n    13// Use LINQ like this...\n    14List<int> evenNums = nums.Where(num => num % 2 == 0).ToList();\n    15\n\nLINQ should be leveraged for simple tasks that make your code more concise without sacrificing readability. Here is another example:\n\nC#\n\n    // Instead of writing a loop to find the smallest number...\n    int smallest = int.MaxValue;\n    foreach (int num in numbers)\n    {\n        if (num < smallest) smallest = num;\n    }\n    \n    // You could simply use LINQ\n    int smallest = numbers.Min();\n    \n\n    1// Instead of writing a loop to find the smallest number...\n    2int smallest = int.MaxValue;\n    3foreach (int num in numbers)\n    4{\n    5    if (num < smallest) smallest = num;\n    6}\n    7\n    8// You could simply use LINQ\n    9int smallest = numbers.Min();\n    10",

          "content": "### Know Delegates and Events\n\nMany candidates struggle with the correct usage of delegates and events, which can lead to messy code and memory leaks. While these don't come up too often in interviews, it is worthwhile to know the ins-and-outs if you want to show mastery here.\n\nC#\n\n    // Incorrect event subscription/unsubscription\n    public delegate void Del();\n    public event Del MyEvent;\n    \n    // Somewhere in the code\n    MyEvent += SomeMethod;\n    MyEvent -= SomeMethod;  // Forgot to unsubscribe the event handler\n    \n\n    1// Incorrect event subscription/unsubscription\n    2public delegate void Del();\n    3public event Del MyEvent;\n    4\n    5// Somewhere in the code\n    6MyEvent += SomeMethod;\n    7MyEvent -= SomeMethod;  // Forgot to unsubscribe the event handler\n    8\n\nC# Interview Replays\n--------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in C#.

Go was the language of choice in those interviews 1% of the time, and engineers who interviewed in Go passed their interviews 51% of the time.\n\nBelow is a distribution of programming languages and their popularity in technical interviews as well as success rates in interviews, by language.\n\n![Go was the language of choice in interviewing.io interviews 1% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Go_usage_in_interviews_6fec9fe0cb.png)\n\n![Go had a fairly average interview success rates – engineers who chose Go as their interview language on interviewing.io passed interviews 51% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Go_success_rate_in_interviews_9384cc74c9.png)\n\nGo Idioms & Idiosyncrasies\n--------------------------\n\nGo, often referred to as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled language renowned for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming. Go was developed by Google, and its design makes it an excellent choice for concurrent and networked programming.\n\nGo's distinct features and programming style allow developers to write clear and efficient code. Here are some of the key aspects of Go that are worth flexing in a technical interview:\n\n*   **Structs and Interfaces**: Go employs structs instead of classes and uses interfaces for abstraction and polymorphism. You should be comfortable defining and using structs and interfaces, understanding how to implement interfaces, and the role of embedding in Go.\n*   **Error Handling**: Go takes a refreshing approach to errors by eschewing exceptions in favor of explicit error handling. This should be familiar to you from the fact that we pass back two values in functions with the second one being any potential errors in that function. Be familiar with the idiomatic Go error handling using the `error` type and always check errors right after they occur.\n*   **Go's Standard Library**: Go boasts a robust and feature-rich standard library. Be comfortable using common packages such as `fmt`, `net/http`, `io`, `os`, and `sync` as these are common topics of trivia in interviews.\n*   **Goroutines and Channels**: Understand the concept of goroutines for lightweight thread management and channels for communication between goroutines. Have a good grasp of Go's concurrency model.\n*   **Defer, Panic, and Recover**: Go has unique error recovery mechanisms through the use of defer, panic, and recover. Understand how and when to use them.\n*   **Slices and Maps**: Slices and maps are key built-in data structures in Go. Be comfortable creating and manipulating slices and maps.\n*   **Go Memory Management**: Understand how Go handles memory allocation, and be aware of Go garbage collection.\n\nCommon Go Interview Mistakes\n----------------------------\n\nWhen interviewing in Go, there are a few common pitfalls to avoid:\n\n### Ignoring Errors\n\nGo doesn't use exceptions for error handling and instead relies on an explicit error return value. Ignoring errors can lead to unpredictable behavior, and it's considered bad practice. Always handle errors right after they occur.\n\nThe most common way this crops up is when a candidate ignores the error returned by a function or method:\n\nGo\n\n    \n    res, _ := http.Get(\"http://example.com/\")\n    \n\n    1\n    2res, _ := http.Get(\"http://example.com/\")\n    3\n\nIn the above code snippet, the Get function returns two values - a Response and an error. Ignoring the error by using an underscore (\\_) is bad practice. It's better to handle the error appropriately:\n\nNever ignore an error return value. Here is an example of handling errors correctly:\n\nGo\n\n    \n    file, err := http.Get(\"http://example.com/\")\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    // continue processing with file\n    \n\n    1\n    2file, err := http.Get(\"http://example.com/\")\n    3if err != nil {\n    4    log.Fatal(err)\n    5}\n    6// continue processing with file\n    7\n\nIn the corrected example, the error is checked, and if it's not nil, the error is logged, and the application is terminated. This approach makes it easy to see when and where the problem occurred, making debugging easier.\n\n### Not Using Concurrency When Appropriate\n\nIn coding interviews, concurrency is a topic that does not tend to come up very often. If you're coding in Go and likely applying for a role in Go then expect concurrency as a possible question type. One of the primary benefits of using Go is its built-in support for concurrent programming via goroutines and channels. Ignoring these features and writing strictly sequential code can be a significant oversight and will prevent you from demonstrating your mastery of one of Go's key strengths.\n\nGo's concurrency model, known as CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes), is one of the language's most powerful features. It allows multiple tasks to run independently of each other and provides a way to communicate between them without the need for locks or shared state, which can lead to complex bugs.\n\nThe `go` keyword in Go is used to launch a new goroutine, which is a lightweight thread of execution. Channels provide a way for these goroutines to communicate safely with each other.\n\nGo\n\n    \n    func printNumbers() {\n        for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {\n            fmt.Println(i)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    func printLetters() {\n        for i := 'a'; i <= 'j'; i++ {\n            fmt.Println(string(i))\n        }\n    }\n    \n    func main() {\n        go printNumbers()\n        go printLetters()\n        time.Sleep(time.Second)\n    }\n    \n\n    1\n    2func printNumbers() {\n    3    for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {\n    4        fmt.Println(i)\n    5    }\n    6}\n    7\n    8func printLetters() {\n    9    for i := 'a'; i <= 'j'; i++ {\n    10        fmt.Println(string(i))\n    11    }\n    12}\n    13\n    14func main() {\n    15    go printNumbers()\n    16    go printLetters()\n    17    time.Sleep(time.Second)\n    18}\n    19\n\nIn the above example, `printNumbers` and `printLetters` are executed concurrently. However, not all problems can or should be solved with concurrency, and its misuse can lead to problems like race conditions. Understanding when and how to use these features appropriately is an essential part of Go programming.\n\n### Misunderstanding Nil Interfaces\n\nIn Go, an interface value is `nil` only if both its type _**and**_ value are `nil`. A common mistake is assuming that an interface holding a `nil` pointer would itself be `nil`, which is incorrect. Here's an illustration:\n\nGo\n\n    \n    type Foo struct {}\n    func (f *Foo) Bar() {}\n    \n    var f *Foo // f is a nil pointer\n    \n    var i interface{} = f\n    \n    if i == nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"i is nil\")\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"i is not nil\") // Output: i is not nil\n    }\n    \n\n    1\n    2type Foo struct {}\n    3func (f *Foo) Bar() {}\n    4\n    5var f *Foo // f is a nil pointer\n    6\n    7var i interface{} = f\n    8\n    9if i == nil {\n    10    fmt.Println(\"i is nil\")\n    11} else {\n    12    fmt.Println(\"i is not nil\") // Output: i is not nil\n    13}\n    14\n\nIn the above example, even though the `f` pointer is `nil`, the interface `i` is not `nil` because it has a type (`*Foo`). This is a subtle point that often trips up even experienced Go programmers. This mistake can lead to panics at runtime if you try to access a method on `i` assuming that it is `nil`.\n\nGo\n\n    \n    type Fooer interface {\n        Bar()\n    }\n    \n    var f *Foo // f is a nil pointer\n    \n    var i Fooer = f\n    \n    if i == nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"i is nil\")\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"i is not nil\") // Output: i is not nil\n    }\n    \n    i.Bar() // Runtime panic: nil pointer dereference\n    \n    \n\n    1\n    2type Fooer interface {\n    3    Bar()\n    4}\n    5\n    6var f *Foo // f is a nil pointer\n    7\n    8var i Fooer = f\n    9\n    10if i == nil {\n    11    fmt.Println(\"i is nil\")\n    12} else {\n    13    fmt.Println(\"i is not nil\") // Output: i is not nil\n    14}\n    15\n    16i.Bar() // Runtime panic: nil pointer dereference\n    17\n    18\n\nIn the above example, we define an interface `Fooer` that has a `Bar` method. `f` is a `nil` pointer to `Foo`, and `i` is an interface of type `Fooer` which holds `f`. Although `f` is `nil`, `i` is not `nil` and calling the `Bar` method on `i` results in a runtime panic as `f` is `nil`.\n\nThus, when working with interfaces in Go, it's crucial to understand the distinction between a `nil` interface value and an interface value that holds a `nil`.\n\nHow to Demonstrate Go Expertise in Interviews\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWhile there are many ways to demonstrate mastery over Go in an interview, show that you aren't a Java/C++ coder that happens to be using Go, you're a Go developer with full understanding of what makes Go a unique language.\n\n*   **Talk about Concurrency**: One of the highlights of Go is its native support for concurrent programming with goroutines and channels. Explaining how you've used these features in your past projects can illustrate your understanding of these essential Go concepts. You could say, _\"I've utilized Go's powerful goroutines and channels to handle multiple tasks concurrently, resulting in more efficient and faster programs.\"_\n*   **Error Handling**: Go has a unique way of handling errors compared to other languages. You could talk about how you've implemented error handling using idiomatic Go code. For example, _\"I've leveraged Go's explicit error handling methodology, always checking for errors where they occur and propagating them up to the appropriate level where they can be handled.\"_\n*   **Interfaces and Type Embedding**: Discuss how you've used interfaces for achieving polymorphism in Go and how type embedding has helped create complex types. You might say, _\"In Go, I've used interfaces extensively to achieve abstraction and polymorphism. I've also found Go's type embedding to be a powerful way to build complex types while avoiding classical inheritance.\"_\n*   **Discuss Go's Simplicity**: Go is known for its simplicity and readability. Talk about how you adhere to this philosophy in your code. You can say, _\"I adhere to Go's philosophy of simplicity, valuing clear and straightforward code over clever one-liners. I believe in writing code that's easy for others (and future me) to read and understand.\"_ This can help you stand out from the Pythonistas who write \"elegant\" (hard-to-read) one-liners and the Java folks that tend to over-engineer and abstract out all common sense from their solutions.\n\nGo Interview Replays\n--------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in Go.

Ruby was the language of choice in those interviews 2% of the time, and engineers who interviewed in Ruby passed their interviews 47% of the time.\n\nBelow is a distribution of programming languages and their popularity in technical interviews as well as success rates in interviews, by language.\n\n![Programming languages distribution in interviewing.io interviews. Ruby gets used in interviews 2% of the time.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Ruby_usage_in_interviews_121c466b8c.png)\n\n![Interview success rates, by programming language, on interviewing.io. Engineers who code in Ruby pass interviews 47% of the time.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Ruby_success_rate_in_interviews_8a4c58579c.png)\n\nAccording to [Stack Overflow's 2023 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-top-paying-technologies)\n, Ruby comes in the four highest-paid languages with a median income of 98.5k USD. GitHub's [Octoverse 2022 report](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages)\n ranks Ruby in the top ten used programming languages globally.\n\nWhat does this mean for you as a candidate? If Ruby is your strongest language, there's no reason to avoid using it in technical interviews. While less common, Ruby is still a viable and respected choice among interviewers.\n\nRuby Idioms & Idiosyncrasies\n----------------------------\n\nAs a language, Ruby is favored by several leading companies, such as [Airbnb](https://interviewing.io/airbnb-interview-questions)\n, GitHub, [Shopify](https://interviewing.io/shopify-interview-questions)\n, and 37Signals, due to its readable syntax and the powerful [Rails framework](https://rubyonrails.org/)\n. While originally designed and developed by [Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz)\n, today there are several implementations available, such as MRI (Matz's Ruby Interpreter), JRuby (which runs on the JVM), and Rubinius, each with their unique features and performance characteristics.\n\nAmong these, [MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_MRI)\n is the reference implementation of Ruby and is most commonly used. It is also the assumed default in most coding interviews unless specified otherwise, given its status as the original and most widespread version of Ruby. [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org/)\n allows for integration with Java, leveraging the power and ecosystem of the JVM, and Rubinius emphasizes concurrency, using a bytecode virtual machine much like the JVM or .NET CLR.\n\nWhen preparing for a Ruby interview, understanding the idioms and idiosyncrasies of the language is essential. Here are the key ones to remember.\n\n### Everything is an Object\n\nIn many programming languages, primitives like integers and booleans are not objects. However, Ruby is a pure object-oriented language, meaning everything in Ruby is an object, even literals like numbers, booleans, and `nil`. This means that every piece of data has methods and instance variables, which can be very powerful.\n\nFor instance, you're given an array of integers and asked to return an array of even numbers. Because everything is an object, you can call the [`select`](https://apidock.com/ruby/Array/select)\n method directly on the array object and pass it a block of code to execute for each element:\n\nRuby\n\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    evens = numbers.select(&:even?)\n    puts evens  # Outputs: [2, 4]\n\n    1numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    2evens = numbers.select(&:even?)\n    3puts evens  # Outputs: [2, 4]\n\nIn this example, `select` is a built-in method provided by the `Array` class, and [`even?`](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Integer/even%3F)\n is a built-in method provided by the `Integer` class. The `&:` syntax is a shorthand that converts `:even?` to a [`Proc`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0/Proc.html)\n object, which is then passed to `select`.\n\n### Truthy and Falsy Values\n\nIn Ruby, only two things are falsy — `false` and `nil`. Everything else is considered to be truthy, including `0`, `0.0`, `\"\"` (empty string), and `[]` (empty array). This differs from other languages where `0`, `\"\"`, or `[]` could be considered falsy.\n\n### Blocks, Procs, Lambdas\n\nRuby is known for its blocks, [procs](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0/Proc.html)\n, and [lambdas](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0/Kernel.html#method-i-lambda)\n, which are chunks of code that can be passed around like objects. They are similar to [Python's lambda functions](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#small-functions-and-the-lambda-expression)\n, [Java's lambda expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html)\n, and [JavaScript's first-class functions](https://interviewing.io/javascript-interview-questions#function-expressions)\n and arrow functions. However, they offer greater flexibility and power that defines Ruby's flavor of functional programming.\n\nRuby\n\n    words = [\"apple\", \"fig\", \"cherry\", \"banana\", \"grape\"]\n    sorted_by_length = words.sort { |a, b| a.length <=> b.length }\n    # sorted_by_length is now [\"fig\", \"apple\", \"grape\", \"cherry\", \"banana\"]\n\n    1words = [\"apple\", \"fig\", \"cherry\", \"banana\", \"grape\"]\n    2sorted_by_length = words.sort { |a, b| a.length <=> b.length }\n    3# sorted_by_length is now [\"fig\", \"apple\", \"grape\", \"cherry\", \"banana\"]\n\nIn this example, a block is passed to the `sort` method to define custom sorting logic. The spaceship operator `<=>` is used to compare the lengths of the strings.\n\n### Dynamic Typing\n\nRuby, similar to [Python](https://interviewing.io/python-interview-questions)\n and [JavaScript](https://interviewing.io/javascript-interview-questions#unique-qualities-of-javascript)\n, is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you define it. Ruby will figure it out for you. Variables are just names for containers that hold references to objects. The type of variable is simply the type of the object they reference.\n\nIn addition, Ruby is strongly typed (unlike JavaScript), which enforces type-checking during runtime. While you don't have to explicitly define a variable's type, once the type is assigned, Ruby won't automatically convert one type to another without explicit instruction.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nRuby\n\n    x = \"Hello, Interviewing.io!\"  # x is a String\n    x = 42  # Now x is an Integer\n    \n    # Ruby won't automatically convert a string into a number\n    y = \"5\"\n    z = y + 2  # This will raise an error because Ruby is strongly typed\n\n    1x = \"Hello, Interviewing.io!\"  # x is a String\n    2x = 42  # Now x is an Integer\n    3\n    4# Ruby won't automatically convert a string into a number\n    5y = \"5\"\n    6z = y + 2  # This will raise an error because Ruby is strongly typed\n\n### Singleton Methods and Metaprogramming\n\n[Metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)\n [in Ruby](https://www.rubyguides.com/2016/04/metaprogramming-in-the-wild/)\n is a technique where a program can treat its code as data and manipulate it accordingly, generating and defining new methods dynamically at runtime. [Singleton methods](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/singletonmethods.html)\n are part of this toolkit, allowing for specific methods to be defined for individual objects.\n\nMetaprogramming is commonly used in Ruby libraries and frameworks such as [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)\n. One of the most well-known examples is how Rails adds methods to [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)\n models based on the column names in the associated database table.\n\nSuppose you have a `User` model with `first_name` and `last_name` attributes. When you retrieve a `User` from the database, Rails dynamically adds methods to that instance for getting and setting these attributes.\n\nRuby\n\n    user = User.find(1)  # Retrieves a User from the database.\n    \n    # Rails uses metaprogramming to define singleton methods on the user instance:\n    def user.first_name\n      self[:first_name]\n    end\n    \n    def user.first_name=(value)\n      self[:first_name] = value\n    end\n    \n    # You can now use these dynamically generated methods:\n    user.first_name = 'Brian'\n    puts user.first_name  # Outputs: \"Brian\"\n\n    1user = User.find(1)  # Retrieves a User from the database.\n    2\n    3# Rails uses metaprogramming to define singleton methods on the user instance:\n    4def user.first_name\n    5  self[:first_name]\n    6end\n    7\n    8def user.first_name=(value)\n    9  self[:first_name] = value\n    10end\n    11\n    12# You can now use these dynamically generated methods:\n    13user.first_name = 'Brian'\n    14puts user.first_name  # Outputs: \"Brian\"\n\nRails internally uses a technique called [`method_missing`](https://apidock.com/ruby/BasicObject/method_missing)\n to achieve this. When you call a method that does not exist, `method_missing` is invoked, and Rails defines these attribute methods on-the-fly.\n\n### Implicit Returns\n\nMethods implicitly return the value of the last statement executed in Ruby, which differs from many languages that require an explicit `return` statement. This can make your code more concise and help in coding interviews where you want to write shorter, cleaner methods.\n\nRuby\n\n    def array_sum(array)\n      # no explicit return statement used\n      array.reduce(0, :+)\n    end\n    \n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    puts array_sum(numbers)  # Outputs: 15\n    \n\n    1def array_sum(array)\n    2  # no explicit return statement used\n    3  array.reduce(0, :+)\n    4end\n    5\n    6numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    7puts array_sum(numbers)  # Outputs: 15\n    8\n\n### Bang Methods\n\nIn Ruby, methods ending with an exclamation mark, often called [\"bang\" methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/612189/why-are-exclamation-marks-used-in-ruby-methods)\n, usually indicate that the method will modify the object it's called on directly rather than returning a new object. This is a convention, not a rule, and it's up to the developer to adhere to this convention when defining their methods.\n\nFor example, for reversing a string, Ruby has `reverse` and `reverse!` methods. `reverse` returns a new string that is the reverse of the original, whereas `reverse!` modifies the original string in place.\n\nWhile using built-in methods or creating your own, it's essential to be aware of this convention and to use it consistently.\n\nCommon Ruby Interview Mistakes\n------------------------------\n\n### Not Knowing the Difference Between `==` and `eql?` Operators\n\nIn Ruby, both `==` and [`eql?`](https://apidock.com/ruby/Object/eql%3F)\n check for equality, but they are used for different types of comparisons. `==` checks if two objects have the same value. It returns `true` even if numbers of different types (integer and float) have the same numerical value Conversely, `eql?` checks both the value and the type of objects. It returns `true` only if both match, hence being more restrictive.\n\nRuby\n\n    # Array with mixed integer and float\n    nums = [1, 2.0, 3, 2]\n    \n    # '==' counts both integer 2 and float 2.0\n    puts nums.count { |num| num == 2 } \n    # Output: 2\n    \n    # 'eql?' counts only integer 2\n    puts nums.count { |num| num.eql? 2 }\n    # Output: 1\n\n    1# Array with mixed integer and float\n    2nums = [1, 2.0, 3, 2]\n    3\n    4# '==' counts both integer 2 and float 2.0\n    5puts nums.count { |num| num == 2 } \n    6# Output: 2\n    7\n    8# 'eql?' counts only integer 2\n    9puts nums.count { |num| num.eql? 2 }\n    10# Output: 1\n\nRuby\n\n    arr = []\n    puts arr.nil?   # Output: false\n    puts arr.empty? # Output: true\n\n    1arr = []\n    2puts arr.nil?   # Output: false\n    3puts arr.empty? # Output: true\n\n### Not Knowing the Difference Between `nil?` and `empty?`\n\n[`nil?`](https://apidock.com/rails/v4.2.7/Object/blank%3F)\n is a method available on all objects and returns `true` if the object it's called on is the special `nil` object. `nil?` is particularly useful when you want to check if a variable has been initialized or not. On the other hand, [`empty?`](https://apidock.com/ruby/Array/empty%3F)\n is a method that isn't universally available to all objects but is primarily used with collections such as Arrays, Hashes, or Strings. This method checks whether the collection contains any elements (for arrays or hashes) or characters (for strings).\n\n### Assuming Rails Methods Are Built-in Ruby Methods\n\n[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)\n extends Ruby with several helpful methods. Mistaking these for built-in Ruby methods can lead to unexpected `NoMethodError` exceptions. For instance, the methods `blank?` and `present?` are commonly used in Rails applications to check if an object is empty, a whitespace string, or `nil`. These methods are convenient, but they're not available in a non-Rails Ruby script.\n\nRuby\n\n    # This code will work in Rails, but not in plain Ruby\n    puts \" \".blank?  # In Rails, Output: true\n    \n    # Use built-in Ruby methods instead\n    puts \" \".empty?  # Output: false\n\n    1# This code will work in Rails, but not in plain Ruby\n    2puts \" \".blank?  # In Rails, Output: true\n    3\n    4# Use built-in Ruby methods instead\n    5puts \" \".empty?  # Output: false\n\n### When to Use Symbols vs. Strings\n\n[Symbols](https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.2/Symbol.html)\n and [strings](https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.2/String.html)\n may look similar, but they are very different and serve different purposes. Symbols are immutable and often used as Hash keys, while strings are mutable and used when the content matters. A common mistake in Ruby is confusing the two, especially when accessing Hash values.\n\nRuby\n\n    hash = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n    puts hash[:a]   # Correct, Output: 1\n    puts hash['a']  # Incorrect, Output: nil\n\n    1hash = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n    2puts hash[:a]   # Correct, Output: 1\n    3puts hash['a']  # Incorrect, Output: nil\n\n### Not Using Instance Variables Correctly\n\nIn Ruby, a variable's scope is denoted by its prefix. [Instance variables](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/instancevars.html)\n are declared with an `@` symbol. Without it, Ruby treats the declaration as a local variable, limiting its scope, which won't have the desired effect.\n\nRuby\n\n    class Person\n      def name=(new_name)\n        # Creates a local variable instead of an instance variable\n        name = new_name\n      end\n    end\n    \n    \n    class Person\n      def name=(new_name)\n        # Creates an instance variable\n        @name = new_name\n      end\n    end\n\n    1class Person\n    2  def name=(new_name)\n    3    # Creates a local variable instead of an instance variable\n    4    name = new_name\n    5  end\n    6end\n    7\n    8\n    9class Person\n    10  def name=(new_name)\n    11    # Creates an instance variable\n    12    @name = new_name\n    13  end\n    14end\n\nForgetting `@` changes a variable's scope from instance-wide to method-specific, causing potential issues in your program.\n\n### When to Employ `and` / `or` vs. `&&` / `||`\n\nRuby has two sets of logical operators: `and` / `or` and `&&` / `||`. Both sets perform logical operations but have different operator precedences, which can lead to different results if not used carefully. `&&` and `||` have higher precedence than `and` and `or`. Moreover, `and` and `or` have lower precedence than the assignment operator `=`. This can lead to unexpected outcomes if `and` or `or` are used with assignments.\n\nRuby\n\n    result = nil or true\n    puts result # Output: nil\n\n    1result = nil or true\n    2puts result # Output: nil\n\nTo avoid such issues, use `&&` and `||` for logical operations and reserve `and` / `or` for control flow, where the right-hand side is only evaluated if needed.\n\nRuby\n\n    # Control flow using 'or'\n    file = File.open('exists.txt') or die \"Can't open file\"\n    \n    # Logical operations using '||'\n    is_tall = is_adult || is_over_six_feet\n    \n\n    1# Control flow using 'or'\n    2file = File.open('exists.txt') or die \"Can't open file\"\n    3\n    4# Logical operations using '||'\n    5is_tall = is_adult || is_over_six_feet\n    6\n\n### Parentheses are Optional\n\nIn Ruby, parentheses are optional for method calls. However, leaving them out is more nuanced than it may seem and can lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully. It is recommended to use a community-accepted style guide such as [RuboCop](https://rubystyle.guide/#method-call-parentheses)\n to avoid such issues.\n\n*   Use parentheses for method invocations, except for DSL methods, methods with \"keyword\" status, and attribute access methods.\n*   Always use parentheses in expressions involving `&&` or `||` operators.\n*   Avoid parentheses for methods without arguments.\n\nRuby\n\n    # Rails migration method, an example of an internal DSL\n    add_column :users, :email, :string\n    \n    # Ruby keyword-like methods\n    puts \"Hello, world!\"    # Output method\n    gets                    # Input method\n    \n    class Person\n      attr_accessor :name, :age   # Defines getter and setter methods for name and age\n    end\n    \n    person = Person.new\n    person.name = \"John\"   # Setter method for name\n    person.age = 30        # Setter method for age\n    \n    # Method invocation when the first argument begins with an open parenthesis\n    x = Math.sin(y)\n    \n    # Always use parentheses in expressions involving logical operators\n    result = (a && b) || c\n    \n    # Avoid parentheses when the method doesn't accept any arguments\n    array.empty?   # No argument method\n\n    1# Rails migration method, an example of an internal DSL\n    2add_column :users, :email, :string\n    3\n    4# Ruby keyword-like methods\n    5puts \"Hello, world!\"    # Output method\n    6gets                    # Input method\n    7\n    8class Person\n    9  attr_accessor :name, :age   # Defines getter and setter methods for name and age\n    10end\n    11\n    12person = Person.new\n    13person.name = \"John\"   # Setter method for name\n    14person.age = 30        # Setter method for age\n    15\n    16# Method invocation when the first argument begins with an open parenthesis\n    17x = Math.sin(y)\n    18\n    19# Always use parentheses in expressions involving logical operators\n    20result = (a && b) || c\n    21\n    22# Avoid parentheses when the method doesn't accept any arguments\n    23array.empty?   # No argument method\n\n### Concatenating Strings / Strings are Mutable in Ruby\n\nRuby strings are mutable objects, meaning they can be changed after creation. The `<<` and `concat` methods take advantage of this by appending to the existing string, resulting in fewer objects and better performance.\n\nOn the other hand, the `+` operator creates a new string object that combines the original strings, which can result in more memory usage and slower performance when concatenating large strings or performing the operation many times.\n\nRuby\n\n    str1 = \"Hello, \"\n    str2 = \"Ruby!\"\n    \n    # This creates a new string\n    puts str1 + str2 # Output: \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n    \n    # These modify the original string\n    str1 << str2\n    puts str1 # Output: \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n    \n    str1.concat(str2)\n    puts str1 # Output: \"Hello, Ruby!Ruby!\"\n\n    1str1 = \"Hello, \"\n    2str2 = \"Ruby!\"\n    3\n    4# This creates a new string\n    5puts str1 + str2 # Output: \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n    6\n    7# These modify the original string\n    8str1 << str2\n    9puts str1 # Output: \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n    10\n    11str1.concat(str2)\n    12puts str1 # Output: \"Hello, Ruby!Ruby!\"\n\n### Confusion between `include` and `extend`\n\nThe `include` method mixes the module methods into an instance of a class, meaning the methods become instance methods. On the other hand, the `extend` method mixes the module methods into the class directly, making them class methods.\n\nA common mistake is to use `include` when you meant to use `extend`, or vice versa, which will not provide the expected functionality.\n\nRuby\n\n    module Greeting\n      def hello\n        \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n      end\n    end\n    \n    class Person\n      include Greeting\n    end\n    \n    class Robot\n      extend Greeting\n    end\n    \n    person = Person.new\n    puts person.hello  # Correct, Output: \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n    \n    puts Robot.hello   # Correct, Output: \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n    \n    robot = Robot.new\n    puts robot.hello   # Incorrect, will raise a NoMethodError\n\n    1module Greeting\n    2  def hello\n    3    \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n    4  end\n    5end\n    6\n    7class Person\n    8  include Greeting\n    9end\n    10\n    11class Robot\n    12  extend Greeting\n    13end\n    14\n    15person = Person.new\n    16puts person.hello  # Correct, Output: \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n    17\n    18puts Robot.hello   # Correct, Output: \"Hello, Ruby!\"\n    19\n    20robot = Robot.new\n    21puts robot.hello   # Incorrect, will raise a NoMethodError\n\n### Misunderstanding `throw`/`catch` and `raise`/`rescue`\n\nRuby error handling is often done with `raise` and `rescue`, which are used to throw and handle exceptions, respectively. `throw` and `catch` are used for control flow and are not directly related to exception handling.\n\nA common mistake is confusing `throw` with `raise` and `catch` with `rescue`. While their names suggest similar functionality, they serve different purposes in Ruby.\n\nRuby\n\n    def faulty_method\n      begin\n        raise \"An error occurred!\"\n      rescue => e\n        puts \"Rescued from error: #{e}\"\n      end\n    end\n    \n    faulty_method  # Output: \"Rescued from error: An error occurred!\"\n    \n    \n    catch :done do\n      10.times do |i|\n        throw :done if i > 5\n        puts i\n      end\n    end\n    # Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5\n    \n\n    1def faulty_method\n    2  begin\n    3    raise \"An error occurred!\"\n    4  rescue => e\n    5    puts \"Rescued from error: #{e}\"\n    6  end\n    7end\n    8\n    9faulty_method  # Output: \"Rescued from error: An error occurred!\"\n    10\n    11\n    12catch :done do\n    13  10.times do |i|\n    14    throw :done if i > 5\n    15    puts i\n    16  end\n    17end\n    18# Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5\n    19\n\n### Not Using Idiomatic Ruby\n\nRuby is renowned for its elegance and expressiveness, which are rooted in the language's idioms. The Ruby community largely follows the guidelines put forth by the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)\n, which is enforced by linting tools like [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/)\n. Here are some common mistakes made when not utilizing idiomatic Ruby, along with their corrections and guidelines.\n\n| Mistake | Correction | Guideline |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `def sum(a, b) (a + b) end` | `def sum(a, b) a + b end` | Omit parentheses for the returned expression. |\n| `{'one' => 1, 'two' => 2}` | `{one: 1, two: 2}` | Use the Ruby hash syntax. |\n| `if some_condition then do_something end` | `do_something if some_condition` | Avoid the use of \\`then\\` for single-line \\`if/unless\\`. |\n| `result = if some_condition then something else something_else end` | `result = some_condition ? something : something_else` | Favor the ternary operator(\\`?:\\`) over \\`if/then/else/end\\` constructs. |\n| `some_method (some_arg)` | `some_method(some_arg)` | Use \\`def\\` with parentheses when there are parameters. |\n| `\"This string contains #{'interpolation'}\"` | `'This string contains interpolation'` | Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols. |\n| `my_array.map do \\|x\\| x * 2 end.sum` | `my_array.map { \\|x\\| x * 2 }.sum` | Prefer \\`{...}\\` over \\`do...end\\` for single-line blocks. Avoid \\`do...end\\` when chaining. |\n\nRuby Interview Replays\n----------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in Ruby.

          "content": "### Everything is an Object\n\nIn many programming languages, primitives like integers and booleans are not objects. However, Ruby is a pure object-oriented language, meaning everything in Ruby is an object, even literals like numbers, booleans, and `nil`. This means that every piece of data has methods and instance variables, which can be very powerful.\n\nFor instance, you're given an array of integers and asked to return an array of even numbers. Because everything is an object, you can call the [`select`](https://apidock.com/ruby/Array/select)\n method directly on the array object and pass it a block of code to execute for each element:\n\nRuby\n\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    evens = numbers.select(&:even?)\n    puts evens  # Outputs: [2, 4]\n\n    1numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    2evens = numbers.select(&:even?)\n    3puts evens  # Outputs: [2, 4]\n\nIn this example, `select` is a built-in method provided by the `Array` class, and [`even?`](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Integer/even%3F)\n is a built-in method provided by the `Integer` class. The `&:` syntax is a shorthand that converts `:even?` to a [`Proc`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0/Proc.html)\n object, which is then passed to `select`.",

They are similar to [Python's lambda functions](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#small-functions-and-the-lambda-expression)\n, [Java's lambda expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html)\n, and [JavaScript's first-class functions](https://interviewing.io/javascript-interview-questions#function-expressions)\n and arrow functions. However, they offer greater flexibility and power that defines Ruby's flavor of functional programming.\n\nRuby\n\n    words = [\"apple\", \"fig\", \"cherry\", \"banana\", \"grape\"]\n    sorted_by_length = words.sort { |a, b| a.length <=> b.length }\n    # sorted_by_length is now [\"fig\", \"apple\", \"grape\", \"cherry\", \"banana\"]\n\n    1words = [\"apple\", \"fig\", \"cherry\", \"banana\", \"grape\"]\n    2sorted_by_length = words.sort { |a, b| a.length <=> b.length }\n    3# sorted_by_length is now [\"fig\", \"apple\", \"grape\", \"cherry\", \"banana\"]\n\nIn this example, a block is passed to the `sort` method to define custom sorting logic.

Ruby will figure it out for you. Variables are just names for containers that hold references to objects. The type of variable is simply the type of the object they reference.\n\nIn addition, Ruby is strongly typed (unlike JavaScript), which enforces type-checking during runtime. While you don't have to explicitly define a variable's type, once the type is assigned, Ruby won't automatically convert one type to another without explicit instruction.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nRuby\n\n    x = \"Hello, Interviewing.io!\"  # x is a String\n    x = 42  # Now x is an Integer\n    \n    # Ruby won't automatically convert a string into a number\n    y = \"5\"\n    z = y + 2  # This will raise an error because Ruby is strongly typed\n\n    1x = \"Hello, Interviewing.io!\"  # x is a String\n    2x = 42  # Now x is an Integer\n    3\n    4# Ruby won't automatically convert a string into a number\n    5y = \"5\"\n    6z = y + 2  # This will raise an error because Ruby is strongly typed",

          "content": "### Singleton Methods and Metaprogramming\n\n[Metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)\n [in Ruby](https://www.rubyguides.com/2016/04/metaprogramming-in-the-wild/)\n is a technique where a program can treat its code as data and manipulate it accordingly, generating and defining new methods dynamically at runtime. [Singleton methods](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/singletonmethods.html)\n are part of this toolkit, allowing for specific methods to be defined for individual objects.\n\nMetaprogramming is commonly used in Ruby libraries and frameworks such as [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)\n. One of the most well-known examples is how Rails adds methods to [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)\n models based on the column names in the associated database table.\n\nSuppose you have a `User` model with `first_name` and `last_name` attributes. When you retrieve a `User` from the database, Rails dynamically adds methods to that instance for getting and setting these attributes.\n\nRuby\n\n    user = User.find(1)  # Retrieves a User from the database.\n    \n    # Rails uses metaprogramming to define singleton methods on the user instance:\n    def user.first_name\n      self[:first_name]\n    end\n    \n    def user.first_name=(value)\n      self[:first_name] = value\n    end\n    \n    # You can now use these dynamically generated methods:\n    user.first_name = 'Brian'\n    puts user.first_name  # Outputs: \"Brian\"\n\n    1user = User.find(1)  # Retrieves a User from the database.\n    2\n    3# Rails uses metaprogramming to define singleton methods on the user instance:\n    4def user.first_name\n    5  self[:first_name]\n    6end\n    7\n    8def user.first_name=(value)\n    9  self[:first_name] = value\n    10end\n    11\n    12# You can now use these dynamically generated methods:\n    13user.first_name = 'Brian'\n    14puts user.first_name  # Outputs: \"Brian\"\n\nRails internally uses a technique called [`method_missing`](https://apidock.com/ruby/BasicObject/method_missing)\n to achieve this. When you call a method that does not exist, `method_missing` is invoked, and Rails defines these attribute methods on-the-fly.",

This is a convention, not a rule, and it's up to the developer to adhere to this convention when defining their methods.\n\nFor example, for reversing a string, Ruby has `reverse` and `reverse!` methods. `reverse` returns a new string that is the reverse of the original, whereas `reverse!` modifies the original string in place.\n\nWhile using built-in methods or creating your own, it's essential to be aware of this convention and to use it consistently.\n\nCommon Ruby Interview Mistakes\n------------------------------",

Rust was the language of choice in those interviews 0.2% of the time. Rust also had the highest success rates – engineers who chose Rust as their interview language passed their interviews 82% of the time.\n\nBelow is a distribution of programming languages and their popularity in technical interviews as well as success rates in interviews, by language.\n\n![Rust was the language of choice in interviewing.io interviews 0.2% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Rust_usage_in_interviews_306f23359c.png)\n\n![Rust had the highest interview success rates – engineers who chose Rust as their interview language on interviewing.io passed interviews 82% of the time](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Rust_success_rate_in_interviews_add5879b3c.png)\n\nRust Idioms & Idiosyncrasies\n----------------------------\n\nAs a modern and advanced language, Rust has a lot of complexity and a lot of still-evolving features. It’s an opinionated language that was designed and continues to be built by people who are morally opposed to hand waving. It’s a language and culture with a fair amount of computer science formality, especially with respect to the type systems.\n\nCandidates and interviewers may be more or less familiar with Rust’s type systems and other internals. The most important recommendation we can make is to make sure that if you’re using Rust-specific terms to describe what you’re doing that you truly understand what they mean. It’s not expected that you’ll know all the details for an interview – and an understanding of all formal definitions is required – but you should be careful not to overreach, and you definitely shouldn’t try to hand wave your way through any explanations, as you’ll find that the tolerance for hand waving among Rust interviewers is much lower than in other interview contexts.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some key, idiomatic concepts you’ll want to be very comfortable with:\n\n*   **Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes**. Rust's ownership model is central to the language and distinguishes it from other systems languages. Make sure you understand concepts like ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and how they prevent data races and memory leaks.\n*   **Pattern matching**. Rust provides powerful pattern matching capabilities through the match keyword. Be familiar with pattern matching syntax and its various applications, such as destructuring enums and matching on values.\n*   **Error handling**. Rust emphasizes explicit error handling to prevent unchecked errors. Know the difference between Result and Option types and how to use Result's unwrap, expect, and match methods. Be aware of error propagation techniques, like the ? operator.\n*   **Collections and iterators**. Rust provides a rich set of collection types and powerful iterator functionality. Be comfortable working with vectors, hash maps, and other collections, as well as using iterators to perform transformations, filters, and aggregations.\n*   **Traits and generics**. Traits allow for code reuse and polymorphism in Rust. Understand how to define traits, implement them for custom types, and use generic functions and structs to write flexible and reusable code.\n*   **Unsafe Rust**. While idiomatic Rust encourages safe programming, understanding unsafe Rust is crucial for dealing with low-level operations or interacting with external code. Know how to use unsafe blocks and functions responsibly, ensuring memory safety and avoiding undefined behavior.\n*   **Cargo and the Standard Library**. Familiarize yourself with Cargo, Rust's build system and package manager. Understand how to create, manage, and publish projects using Cargo, as well as how to leverage the standard library's modules and functionality effectively.\n\nCommon Rust Interview Mistakes\n------------------------------\n\nFirst and foremost, as with any language, you should NOT choose Rust as a way to show off if you don’t know it well. Make sure that you pick a language you are very comfortable with, have used at work recently, and have interviewed before.\n\nOutside of that, here are some things you should try to avoid when interviewing in Rust specifically.\n\n*   **Using a bunch of unsafe blocks**. Sometimes that may be handy for temporarily working around a compilation problem or quickly accomplishing a task during an interview, but in general the people interviewing you in Rust are going to want to see you use the language's safety features.\n*   **Not doing proper error handling.** In most cases, the compiler will stop you from not handling an unexpected value/result, but having default panics on almost every line is not idiomatic Rust. In other words, don’t do this:\n\nRust\n\n    use std::fs::File;\n    use std::io::Read;\n    \n    fn read_file_contents(file_path: &str) -> String {\n        let mut file = File::open(file_path).unwrap();\n        let mut contents = String::new();\n        file.read_to_string(&mut contents).unwrap();\n        contents\n    }\n    \n    fn main() {\n        let file_path = \"nonexistent_file.txt\";\n        let contents = read_file_contents(file_path);\n        println!(\"File contents: {}\", contents);\n    }\n\n    1use std::fs::File;\n    2use std::io::Read;\n    3\n    4fn read_file_contents(file_path: &str) -> String {\n    5    let mut file = File::open(file_path).unwrap();\n    6    let mut contents = String::new();\n    7    file.read_to_string(&mut contents).unwrap();\n    8    contents\n    9}\n    10\n    11fn main() {\n    12    let file_path = \"nonexistent_file.txt\";\n    13    let contents = read_file_contents(file_path);\n    14    println!(\"File contents: {}\", contents);\n    15}\n\n*   **Make sure you understand the core principles** (e.g., memory allocation, memory safety) and the motivations for why the language is designed the way it is, rather than focusing on the latest Rust nightly feature. This is a common failure mode for people who are coming from higher-level languages.\n*   **Understand the borrow checker**. If you don’t know what the borrow checker is and what kind of problems it’s trying to prevent, you’re going to have trouble building rapport with some Rust interviewers.\n*   **Use crates that you’re familiar with, even if your interviewer suggests a specific one**. For some interview questions, you may find that using a particular crate will make things a lot easier, and that’s fine as long as you’re familiar with it. You might run into a situation, however, where your interviewer proposes that you use a crate that you aren’t familiar with. For example, there are different crates for ORMs, async.io frameworks, and web frameworks – multiple ways of doing the same thing– so it’s entirely possible that you’re more familiar with one and your interviewer is more familiar with another. It’s better to demonstrate mastery over something that you know well rather than coding on your back foot.\n\nHow to Demonstrate Rust Expertise in Interviews\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nTo impress your interviewer, go deep on some of the core ideas behind the Rust type system and the core ideas on the borrow checker and the way it does Rust memory management and why.\n\nMore senior engineers who are already working in Rust daily and are involved in the community can demonstrate knowledge of the latest Rust language proposals and advanced nightly features. Keep in mind, however, that this demonstration of mastery is only credible if it takes place on top of a strong foundation of fundamentals that you’ve already established earlier in the interview. Otherwise you might come off like you’re hand waving… which we sternly talked about in the beginning.\n\nRust Interview Replays\n----------------------\n\nBelow you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in Rust. The questions asked in these interviews tend to be language-agnostic (rather than asking about language-specific details and idiosyncrasies), but in these cases, the interviewee chose Rust as the language they would work in.\n\n[![Meeting Rooms](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FRust_FAANG_10_4b35ec71d8.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nAmazon Interviewer\\\n\\\nMeeting Rooms\\\n\\\nRocket Samurai, an Amazon engineer, interviewed Professor Squirrel in Rust](https://interviewing.io/mocks/amazon-rust-minimum-room-count)\n\n[![K nearest restaurants](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FRust_Google_27_d73937f692.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nK nearest restaurants\\\n\\\nImmutable Automaton, a Google engineer, interviewed Professor Squirrel in Rust](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-rust-k-nearest-restaurants)\n\n[![Design a leaderboard](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FRust_Google_39_c1799e9ada.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nDesign a leaderboard\\\n\\\nRed Maelstrom, a Google engineer, interviewed Professor Squirrel in Rust](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-rust-design-a-leaderboard)\n\n[![Rate Limiter](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FRust_Google_40_7761c16362.png&w=3840&q=75)\\\n\\\nGoogle Interviewer\\\n\\\nRate Limiter\\\n\\\nDoctor Squab, a Google engineer, interviewed Professor Squirrel in Rust](https://interviewing.io/mocks/google-rust-rate-limiter)\n\n[See more like this](https://interviewing.io/mocks?language=rust)\n\n![Interview Problems](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FHeroImage.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAbout interviewing.io\n---------------------\n\ninterviewing.io is a **[mock interview practice platform](https://interviewing.io/)\n**.

Keep in mind, however, that this demonstration of mastery is only credible if it takes place on top of a strong foundation of fundamentals that you’ve already established earlier in the interview. Otherwise you might come off like you’re hand waving… which we sternly talked about in the beginning. Rust Interview Replays ---------------------- Below you can find replays of mock interviews conducted on our platform in Rust. The questions asked in these interviews tend to be language-agnostic (rather than asking about language-specific details and idiosyncrasies), but in these cases, the interviewee chose Rust as the language they would work in.

Most companies will ask system design questions during the onsite, but some may include a system design component in their technical phone screen (more likely if they’re a startup rather than a [FAANG](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process)\n).\n\nSystem design interview questions fall, by and large, into the following 12 categories:\n\n1.  APIs\n2.  Databases (SQL vs NoSQL)\n3.  Scaling\n4.  CAP theorem\n5.  Web authentication and basic security\n6.  Load balancers\n7.  Caching\n8.  Message queues\n9.  Indexing\n10.  Failovers\n11.  Replication\n12.  Consistent hashing\n\nThat’s a long list, and system design is a really broad topic. Rather than trying to summarize everything you need to know about these types of interviews in a few paragraphs (an impossible task), we’ve written the best guide to system design interviews out there.\n\nBy the way, many people believe that in order to pass a FAANG system design interview, you have to have professional experience with distributed systems. We’ll show you that that’s categorically false, and that with the right preparation, you don’t need to fall into the catch-22 of having to have worked at a FAANG in order to get a job at a FAANG.\n\nCheck out our in-depth guide to system design, developed by the [best interviewers](https://interviewing.io/blog/our-business-depends-on-having-the-best-interviewers-so-we-built-an-interviewer-rating-system-and-you-can-too)\n in the industry, directly from their experience in thousands of technical interviews:\n\nSystem Design Interview Replays\n-------------------------------\n\n[![Design

This operation is fundamental to many practical scenarios, from ordering a list of contacts by name in your phone's contact list to sorting posts by date on a social media platform. Search engines, databases, and e-commerce websites extensively utilize sorting algorithms to provide faster and more efficient services.\n\nFrom a coding interview perspective, a strong understanding of sorting algorithms demonstrates your problem-solving abilities, knowledge of time and space complexity, and ability to select the most efficient algorithm for a given situation.\n\nAt its core, sorting involves taking input data and writing a program that outputs it in a particular order. The input could be an array of numbers, a list of strings, or even complex data structures. The goal is to output this data sorted according to a specific rule, like ascending order for numbers or lexicographically for strings.\n\n### Types\n\nSorting algorithms can be broadly divided into two categories: comparison sorts and non-comparison sorts. Comparison sorts work by comparing elements and deciding their order based on the result; examples are Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort. On the other hand, non-comparison sorts do not make decisions based on comparing elements but on distributing the individual items (e.g., Counting Sort and Radix Sort).\n\nWhile you should know all common sorting algorithms, from a coding interview perspective, you'll see quick sort, merge sort, and heap sort more often than others. Please note that while it's uncommon to be asked to implement these algorithms from scratch in a coding interview, the principles underlying these algorithms often inform the solutions to a variety of complex problems. Therefore, we'll focus on these three algorithms in this section.\n\n### Quick Sort\n\nQuick Sort is a \"[divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm)\n\" sorting algorithm known for its average-case performance. It selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays based on whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.\n\n![Quick Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sorting_1_7518a33da6.gif) _Quick Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)_\n\n**Time Complexity**: The average and best case is `O(n log n)`, but the worst case is `O(n^2)`, when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot.\n\n**Space Complexity**: `O(log n)` due to the stack space during recursive calls.\n\nLet's see its implementation now:\n\nPython\n\n    def quick_sort(arr):\n        quick_sort_helper(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n    \n    def quick_sort_helper(arr, start, end):\n        if start >= end:\n            return\n    \n        pivot_index = partition(arr, start, end)\n        quick_sort_helper(arr, start, pivot_index - 1)\n        quick_sort_helper(arr, pivot_index + 1, end)\n    \n    def partition(arr, start, end):\n        pivot = arr[end]\n        i = start\n        for j in range(start, end):\n            if arr[j] < pivot:\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n                i += 1\n        arr[i], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[i]\n        return i\n    \n\n    1def quick_sort(arr):\n    2    quick_sort_helper(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n    3\n    4def quick_sort_helper(arr, start, end):\n    5    if start >= end:\n    6        return\n    7\n    8    pivot_index = partition(arr, start, end)\n    9    quick_sort_helper(arr, start, pivot_index - 1)\n    10    quick_sort_helper(arr, pivot_index + 1, end)\n    11\n    12def partition(arr, start, end):\n    13    pivot = arr[end]\n    14    i = start\n    15    for j in range(start, end):\n    16        if arr[j] < pivot:\n    17            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    18            i += 1\n    19    arr[i], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[i]\n    20    return i\n    21\n\nIn the provided Python implementation of Quick Sort, the function `quick_sort_helper` serves as the [recursive](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n driver. It divides the array around a pivot, selected as the last element within a particular segment, through the `partition` function. All elements less than the pivot are moved to its left, and those greater to its right, correctly positioning the pivot within the sorted array. The `quick_sort_helper` function then recursively applies this process to the sections on either side of the pivot.\n\n### Merge Sort\n\nMerge Sort is another \"divide and conquer\" sorting algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into N sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Then, it repeatedly merges these sublists to produce new sorted sublists until only one sublist remains.\n\n![Merge Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sorting_2_73b25f5e3e.gif) _Merge Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)_\n\n**Time Complexity**: Merge Sort performs consistently well with a time complexity of `O(n log n)` in all cases.\n\n**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, as it requires auxiliary space to store the temporary arrays.\n\nLet's look at some example code:\n\nPython\n\n    def merge_sort(arr):\n        # base case\n        if len(arr) <= 1:\n            return arr\n    \n        # divide the array into two halves\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n        left = arr[:mid]\n        right = arr[mid:]\n    \n        # sort each half\n        return merge(merge_sort(left), merge_sort(right))\n    \n    def merge(left, right):\n        result = []\n        i = j = 0\n    \n        # merge the two arrays together\n        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n            if left[i] < right[j]:\n                result.append(left[i])\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                result.append(right[j])\n                j += 1\n    \n        # add any remaining elements\n        result.extend(left[i:])\n        result.extend(right[j:])\n        return result\n\n    1def merge_sort(arr):\n    2    # base case\n    3    if len(arr) <= 1:\n    4        return arr\n    5\n    6    # divide the array into two halves\n    7    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    8    left = arr[:mid]\n    9    right = arr[mid:]\n    10\n    11    # sort each half\n    12    return merge(merge_sort(left), merge_sort(right))\n    13\n    14def merge(left, right):\n    15    result = []\n    16    i = j = 0\n    17\n    18    # merge the two arrays together\n    19    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n    20        if left[i] < right[j]:\n    21            result.append(left[i])\n    22            i += 1\n    23        else:\n    24            result.append(right[j])\n    25            j += 1\n    26\n    27    # add any remaining elements\n    28    result.extend(left[i:])\n    29    result.extend(right[j:])\n    30    return result\n\nHere, the function `merge_sort` acts as the primary function, dividing the array into two halves recursively until a base case of a single element array is achieved.\n\nOnce the array is broken down, the merge function combines these halves back together in sorted order. The merge function initiates by comparing elements at the start of the left and right arrays, appending the smaller one to the `result` array. This process continues until one array is exhausted, after which any remaining elements from the non-empty array are appended to the `result`.\n\nMerge Sort is particularly effective for sorting [linked lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n. This is because linked lists have slow access times but efficient insertion and deletion operations. Merge Sort is very efficient with sequential access data like linked lists, and it doesn't require random access to data.\n\n### Heap Sort\n\nHeap Sort uses a binary [heap](https://interviewing.io/heaps-interview-questions)\n data structure to sort elements. A binary heap is a complete binary tree, which can be either a max heap or a min-heap. In a max heap, the parent node is always larger than or equal to its children, while in a min-heap, the parent node is less than or equal to its children. The binary heap data structure lets us quickly access the largest (max heap) or smallest (min-heap) element.\n\nHeap Sort first builds a max heap from the input data, then continuously removes the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the sorted array.\n\n![Heap Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sorting_3_03129bf773.gif) _Heap Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)_\n\n**Time Complexity**: Heap Sort performs consistently with a time complexity of `O(n log n)` in all cases.\n\n**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as it does not require extra space beyond what is needed to store the input.\n\nThe following code shows how to implement Heap Sort:\n\nPython\n\n    import heapq\n    \n    def heap_sort(arr):\n        heapq.heapify(arr)\n        sorted_arr = []\n        while arr:\n            sorted_arr.append(heapq.heappop(arr))\n        return sorted_arr\n    \n    \n    # Note\n    # We use Python's built-in heapq module to implement Heap Sort. In an interview,\n    # you can ask the interviewer if you can use this module or if you need to \n    # implement the heap data structure yourself.\n    \n\n    1import heapq\n    2\n    3def heap_sort(arr):\n    4    heapq.heapify(arr)\n    5    sorted_arr = []\n    6    while arr:\n    7        sorted_arr.append(heapq.heappop(arr))\n    8    return sorted_arr\n    9\n    10\n    11# Note\n    12# We use Python's built-in heapq module to implement Heap Sort. In an interview,\n    13# you can ask the interviewer if you can use this module or if you need to \n    14# implement the heap data structure yourself.\n    15\n\n### Stability of Sorting Algorithms\n\nImagine you're at a library, organizing books on a shelf. You might first arrange them alphabetically by the author's last name. But then, you notice several books by the same author. To make it easier for readers, you decide to sort these books by publication year. However, you wouldn't want this secondary sort to mix up the primary alphabetical order you've already established. This is the essence of a \"stable\" sort in computer science.\n\nIn more technical terms, a sorting algorithm is \"stable\" if it maintains the original order of equal elements in the sorted output. Think of it like sorting a deck of cards. Let's say you first sort them by number. Next, you decide to sort by suit—clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. A stable sort ensures that the '2' of clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades maintain their original order even after the suit sort.\n\nThis characteristic is not just a theoretical concept but has practical implications in various real-world scenarios. Consider sorting entries in a database—preserving the original order of entries with the same key can be critical.\n\n![Relative ordering is preserved in a stable sort of elements](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sorting_4_957006e469.png)\n\nAs a developer, you'll encounter both stable and unstable sorting algorithms. For example, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort are stable sorting algorithms preserving the original order. In contrast, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort are not—they might mix up the original order of equal elements. Therefore, understanding the stability of a sorting algorithm is crucial when choosing the right one for your task.\n\n### In-Place Sorting Algorithms\n\nAn in-place sorting algorithm sorts the input data within the data structure containing it, using a fixed, small amount of extra space. This \"extra space\" is typically not dependent on the size of the input; hence these algorithms have a space complexity of `O(1)`. These algorithms are beneficial when memory usage is a concern, as they don't require additional storage proportional to the input size.\n\nQuick Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort are examples of in-place sorting algorithms, while Merge Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort require additional space, so they are not in-place.\n\n### Cheat Sheet\n\n| Algorithm | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity | When to Use |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Quick Sort | `O(n log n)` | `O(n log n)` | `O(n^2)` | `O(log n)` | When average case performance is important |\n| Merge Sort | `O(n log n)` | `O(n log n)` | `O(n log n)` | `O(n)` | When stability and worst-case performance are more important than memory usage |\n| Heap Sort | `O(n log n)` | `O(n log n)` | `O(n log n)` | `O(1)` | When memory is a concern, and worst-case performance is important |\n| Insertion Sort | `O(n)` | `O(n^2)` | `O(n^2)` | `O(1)` | When the input is small or nearly sorted |\n| Bubble Sort | `O(n)` | `O(n^2)` | `O(n^2)` | `O(1)` | When the input is small or nearly sorted |\n| Selection Sort | `O(n^2)` | `O(n^2)` | `O(n^2)` | `O(1)` | When memory is a concern, and the input is small |\n| Counting Sort | `O(n + k)` | `O(n + k)` | `O(n + k)` | `O(n + k)` | When the range of potential items (k) is known and not too large |\n\n  \n\nCompanies That Ask Sorting Questions\n------------------------------------\n\n[![Amazon](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Famazon_128x128_15213fbc98.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Watch 31  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=amazon)\n\n[![Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fmicrosoft_com_128x128_e8c2de6d0b.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Watch 24  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=microsoft)\n\n[![Netflix](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fnetflix_com_128x128_6507a7127a.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix)\n\n[Netflix](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix)\n\n[Watch 2  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=netflix)\n\n[![Airbnb](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fairbnb_com_128x128_f1749fbd52.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/airbnb-interview-questions)\n\n[Airbnb](https://interviewing.io/airbnb-interview-questions)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/airbnb-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=airbnb)\n\n[![Shopify](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fshopify_com_128x128_897fef7bc1.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/shopify-interview-questions)\n\n[Shopify](https://interviewing.io/shopify-interview-questions)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/shopify-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=shopify)\n\nWhen to Use Sorting in Interviews\n---------------------------------\n\nIn coding interviews, you may not often be asked to implement a sorting algorithm from scratch, but understanding the principles behind these algorithms can lead to an efficient solution. Moreover, sorting algorithms are often used as subroutines in other algorithms, such as [searching algorithms](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n that require a sorted list as input. In such cases, it's generally accepted that you can leverage existing libraries for this. However, understanding when and how to use sorting effectively within your solutions is a critical skill that interviewers will be looking for.\n\n### Partitioning Problems\n\nIn a partitioning problem, you are typically asked to rearrange an array so that all array elements satisfying a specific condition are grouped together. The pivot element serves as a boundary for this segregation. Problems that ask you to segregate even and odd numbers, separate negative and positive numbers, or move all zeros to the end of an array fall into this category. Partitioning is a fundamental operation in Quick Sort and can be used to solve these types of problems efficiently.\n\nHere's an example of a problem: [Given an array, move all the negative elements to one side of the array](https://interviewing.io/questions/partition-list)\n.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the partitioning logic from quick sort:\n\nPython\n\n    def rearrange_elements(arr):\n        pivot = 0  # partition around 0 for positive/negative segregation\n        i = -1\n        for j in range(len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] < pivot:\n                i += 1\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        return arr\n    \n    print(rearrange_elements([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, -7]))\n    # Output: [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 2]\n\n    1def rearrange_elements(arr):\n    2    pivot = 0  # partition around 0 for positive/negative segregation\n    3    i = -1\n    4    for j in range(len(arr)):\n    5        if arr[j] < pivot:\n    6            i += 1\n    7            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    8    return arr\n    9\n    10print(rearrange_elements([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, -7]))\n    11# Output: [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 2]\n\nIn the code above, we initialize `i` as -1 and iterate over the array. Whenever we find a negative element, we increment `i` and swap the current element with the element at index `i`. This pushes all negative elements towards the front of the array (or left side if visualized as a line).\n\nUnderstanding partitioning and how it segregates data based on a condition helps solve a broad range of problems, and it is a typical pattern in many coding interview questions.\n\n### Selection Problems\n\nSelection problems often involve finding the `k`th smallest or largest element in an array. These problems can take advantage of the selection algorithm used in Quick Sort or Heap Sort. Both methods have their strengths and are suited to different situations. Understanding the difference can lead to more efficient solutions and exhibit your algorithmic knowledge in interviews.\n\nFor instance, let's consider the problem of finding the `k`th largest element in an unsorted array.\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to sort the array and then index the `k`th largest element. While this method works, it can be inefficient, especially with large arrays, as the time complexity of sorting is `O(n log n)`.\n\nPython\n\n    def kth_largest(nums, k):\n        nums.sort(reverse=True)\n        return nums[k-1]\n    \n\n    1def kth_largest(nums, k):\n    2    nums.sort(reverse=True)\n    3    return nums[k-1]\n    4\n\n#### Heap Based Solution\n\nA more optimal solution than naive sorting involves using a min-heap of size `k`. This reduces the time complexity to `O(n log k)`, which is better when `k` is significantly smaller than `n`.\n\nPython\n\n    import heapq\n    \n    def kth_largest(nums, k):\n        heap = []\n        for num in nums:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, num)\n            if len(heap) > k:\n                heapq.heappop(heap)\n        return heapq.heappop(heap)\n    \n\n    1import heapq\n    2\n    3def kth_largest(nums, k):\n    4    heap = []\n    5    for num in nums:\n    6        heapq.heappush(heap, num)\n    7        if len(heap) > k:\n    8            heapq.heappop(heap)\n    9    return heapq.heappop(heap)\n    10\n\nIn this code, we're maintaining a min heap of size `k`, where the root of the heap is the `k`th largest element so far. We iterate over each element in the array, and for each element, we add it to the heap and remove the smallest element if the heap size exceeds `k`. By the end of the iteration, the root of the heap is our desired `k`th largest element.\n\n#### QuickSelect Based Solution\n\nThe QuickSelect algorithm is another method that can be used to solve selection problems more efficiently. This algorithm, a derivative of the Quick Sort algorithm, uses partitioning to find the `k`th smallest or largest element in an unsorted list.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the QuickSelect algorithm to find the `k`th largest element:\n\nPython\n\n    def partition(nums, low, high):\n        # Choose rightmost as pivot\n        pivot = nums[high]\n        i = low\n        for j in range(low, high)\n            # Partition array\n            if nums[j] <= pivot:\n                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]\n                i += 1\n    \n        # Finalize pivot position\n        nums[i], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[i]\n        return i\n    \n    def quick_select(nums, low, high, k):\n        if low == high:\n            # Single element base case\n            return nums[low]\n        \n        # Find pivot index\n        pivot_index = partition(nums, low, high)\n        if k == pivot_index:\n            # Pivot matches k\n            return nums[k]\n        elif k < pivot_index:\n            # Recurse on left partition\n            return quick_select(nums, low, pivot_index - 1, k)\n        else:\n            # Recurse on right partition\n            return quick_select(nums, pivot_index + 1, high, k)\n    \n    def kth_largest(nums, k):\n        # Translate kth largest to kth smallest\n        return quick_select(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, len(nums) - k) \n    \n\n    1def partition(nums, low, high):\n    2    # Choose rightmost as pivot\n    3    pivot = nums[high]\n    4    i = low\n    5    for j in range(low, high)\n    6        # Partition array\n    7        if nums[j] <= pivot:\n    8            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]\n    9            i += 1\n    10\n    11    # Finalize pivot position\n    12    nums[i], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[i]\n    13    return i\n    14\n    15def quick_select(nums, low, high, k):\n    16    if low == high:\n    17        # Single element base case\n    18        return nums[low]\n    19    \n    20    # Find pivot index\n    21    pivot_index = partition(nums, low, high)\n    22    if k == pivot_index:\n    23        # Pivot matches k\n    24        return nums[k]\n    25    elif k < pivot_index:\n    26        # Recurse on left partition\n    27        return quick_select(nums, low, pivot_index - 1, k)\n    28    else:\n    29        # Recurse on right partition\n    30        return quick_select(nums, pivot_index + 1, high, k)\n    31\n    32def kth_largest(nums, k):\n    33    # Translate kth largest to kth smallest\n    34    return quick_select(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, len(nums) - k) \n    35\n\nThe QuickSelect algorithm can solve the problem in `O(n)` time on average, although the worst-case scenario can be `O(n^2)` when the pivot is the smallest or largest element in the list. However, the worst case is highly unlikely if we randomly select a pivot.\n\nComparing this with the heap-based solution, the heap-based solution has a time complexity of `O(n log k)`. The heap-based solution could be more efficient for very large `n` and small `k`. However, if `k` is relatively close to `n`, QuickSelect's `O(n)` average time complexity can be more efficient. Therefore, it's essential to understand these time complexities and the nature of the problem to select the most efficient solution in a coding interview.\n\nYou can see a detailed discussion on [how to find `k`th smallest element here](https://interviewing.io/questions/kth-smallest-element)\n.\n\n### Merge Based Problems\n\nMerge-based problems often involve performing operations on sorted arrays or lists. These problems can take advantage of the merging step in `MergeSort`. By understanding the merge operation, you can solve a range of problems that involve merging more efficiently.\n\nFor instance, a classic problem is \"Merge Intervals\". Given a collection of intervals, merge any overlapping intervals.\n\nA naive approach to this problem would involve comparing each interval with every other interval, leading to a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.\n\nHowever, by sorting the intervals and then merging, we can solve this problem in `O(n log n)` time.\n\nHere's an example solution in Python:\n\nPython\n\n    def merge_intervals(intervals):\n        if not intervals:\n            return []\n        # sort the intervals based on the start time\n        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        merged = [intervals[0]]\n        for current in intervals:\n            # compare the current interval with the last merged interval\n            last = merged[-1]\n            if current[0] <= last[1]:\n                # if they overlap, merge them by updating the end of the last interval\n                last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])\n            else:\n                # if they do not overlap, add the current interval to the merged list\n                merged.append(current)\n        return merged\n    \n\n    1def merge_intervals(intervals):\n    2    if not intervals:\n    3        return []\n    4    # sort the intervals based on the start time\n    5    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    6    merged = [intervals[0]]\n    7    for current in intervals:\n    8        # compare the current interval with the last merged interval\n    9        last = merged[-1]\n    10        if current[0] <= last[1]:\n    11            # if they overlap, merge them by updating the end of the last interval\n    12            last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])\n    13        else:\n    14            # if they do not overlap, add the current interval to the merged list\n    15            merged.append(current)\n    16    return merged\n    17\n\nWe first sort the intervals in the above code based on their start time. We then iterate over the sorted intervals and merge them if they overlap or add them to the result list if they do not.\n\nUnderstanding merge operations helps deal with problems involving sorted arrays or lists and demonstrates your ability to leverage sorting techniques to simplify complex problems during coding interviews.\n\n### Using Custom Comparators\n\nBuilding upon the concept in the last section, a critical aspect that plays an integral role in various sorting-related problems, especially in languages that support it, is custom comparators. A custom comparator is a function that we provide to the sorting function, dictating the sorting order beyond natural ordering.\n\nWe used a custom comparator in the merge intervals problem we discussed: `key=lambda x: x[0]`. The `key` function provided to the sort method determines the attribute upon which the list is sorted. Here, we instruct Python to sort the `intervals` array by the first element of each interval. This allows us to sort the intervals by their start times, enabling us to handle overlaps more efficiently.\n\nThe `sort` method uses the return value of the comparator function to decide the order of elements. If for two intervals `a` and `b`, `a[0]` (the start time of `a`) is less than `b[0]` (the start time of `b`), `a` will come before `b` in the sorted list. Conversely, if `a[0]` is greater than `b[0]`, `a` will come after `b` in the sorted list. If both are equal, then the original order is preserved because Python's sort is stable. If we want to sort in descending order, we can simply reverse the comparison: `key=lambda x: -x[0]`.\n\nUnderstanding and correctly using custom comparators shows your grasp on sorting algorithms and indicates your ability to leverage language-specific features to solve complex problems.\n\nBelow, we show an example code of how to use custom comparators with Python, Java, and JavaScript.\n\nPythonJavaJavaScript\n\n    # Sorting an array of tuples based on the second element\n    arr = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 3)]\n    # We use the `key` argument in the `sort` method to provide a custom comparator\n    arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    print(arr)  # Output: [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]\n\n    1# Sorting an array of tuples based on the second element\n    2arr = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 3)]\n    3# We use the `key` argument in the `sort` method to provide a custom comparator\n    4arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    5print(arr)  # Output: [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]\n\n### External Sorting\n\nExternal Sorting is a class of algorithms that deal with massive amounts of data that cannot fit entirely into a computer's memory. The idea is to divide the data into chunks that can fit into memory, sort these chunks separately, and then merge them.\n\nAn instance of a problem that might require external sorting is when you're given a massive log file (several gigabytes) and asked to sort the entries by timestamp. Trying to load the entire file into memory would likely be impractical, if not impossible, given the limitations of your computer's memory.\n\nA typical approach to this problem would be to use a divide-and-conquer strategy similar to Merge Sort:\n\n1.  Divide the log file into smaller chunks that fit into memory.\n2.  Sort each chunk separately.\n3.  Merge the sorted chunks.\n\nThis merging step can be accomplished using a [priority queue](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions#advanced-queue-structures-priority-queues)\n (min-heap), which always pops the smallest element. The priority queue should be initialized with the smallest element from each chunk. Each time an element is popped from the priority queue, we push the next element from the same chunk into the queue.\n\nWhile it's rare to ask candidates to write a complete external sorting algorithm during an interview due to its complexity, the concept could come up in [system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview/part-two)\n or discussions about handling large data sets. Understanding this concept would demonstrate your knowledge of handling and processing large data.\n\n(Note: Actual implementation of an external sort in a coding interview is rare, and most languages or databases offer built-in functionality for handling this sort of problem. However, it's important to understand the principles behind it.)\n\n### Enhancing the Efficiency of Solutions\n\nIn many coding interview problems, the key to creating an efficient solution often lies in pre-processing the input data. Sorting is one of the most common pre-processing steps that can significantly enhance the efficiency of your solution. This is because operations like searching for elements, finding minimum or maximum elements, and comparing elements can be done much faster on sorted data.\n\nConsider a problem where you are asked to [find a pair of elements in an array that sum up to a target value](https://interviewing.io/questions/two-sum)\n. A brute force solution would involve a nested loop, comparing each element with every other element, leading to a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.\n\nHowever, by sorting the array first, we can use a [two-pointer approach](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n where one pointer starts from the beginning and the other starts from the end. We then move the pointers inward until they meet, effectively searching the array in `O(n)` time. This reduces the total time complexity to `O(n log n)` for sorting plus `O(n)` for searching, significantly improving the brute force approach.\n\nPython\n\n    def two_sum(nums, target):\n        nums.sort()\n        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n        while left < right:\n            current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]\n            if current_sum == target:\n                return [nums[left], nums[right]]\n            elif current_sum < target:\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                right -= 1\n        return []\n    \n    print(two_sum([3,5,2,8,1], 10))  # Output: [2, 8]\n\n    1def two_sum(nums, target):\n    2    nums.sort()\n    3    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    4    while left < right:\n    5        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]\n    6        if current_sum == target:\n    7            return [nums[left], nums[right]]\n    8        elif current_sum < target:\n    9            left += 1\n    10        else:\n    11            right -= 1\n    12    return []\n    13\n    14print(two_sum([3,5,2,8,1], 10))  # Output: [2, 8]\n\nIn this example, sorting the array first allows us to search for the pair in linear time, significantly improving the efficiency of our solution.\n\nAnother scenario where sorting improves efficiency is when binary search is applied. Sorting the data allows binary search to work, reducing search time from `O(n)` in a linear search to `O(log n)`. You can check our detailed guide on [binary search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n for a more in-depth understanding and application in interview scenarios.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that understanding how sorting can be used to enhance the efficiency of your solutions will enable you to solve problems more effectively in coding interviews.\n\n### Checking Anagram Strings\n\nAnagram problems are a common subset of [string manipulation problems](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n that often come up in coding interviews. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as \"cinema\", formed from \"iceman\". In the context of coding interviews, anagrams are usually represented as strings of characters.\n\nSorting can be a highly effective strategy for solving anagram problems because when two strings are anagrams of each other, their sorted forms are identical.\n\nCommon Mistakes in Interviews Featuring Sorting\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n### Overlooking the Time Complexity of Sorting\n\nEven if an approach seems to give you the correct answer, it's crucial to consider its efficiency, particularly in terms of time complexity. A common pitfall is overlooking the added time complexity of sorting when used in a solution.\n\nFor instance, consider the [two-sum problem](https://interviewing.io/questions/two-sum)\n discussed earlier, where we find a pair in an array that adds up to a particular target value. In a previously discussed approach, we used sorting and two-pointers. This approach does yield correct results; however, the sorting step adds significant time complexity.\n\nThe sort operation itself has a time complexity of `O(n log n)`, which might overshadow the subsequent two-pointer traversal of the array that only takes `O(n)` time. If `n` is large, this increased time complexity due to sorting could significantly affect the performance of your solution.\n\nWhile the sort and two-pointer method is valid, a more time-efficient solution exists. Using a hash map to track the elements you've encountered as you traverse the array, you can check if the complement to the target value has already been seen in constant time. This alternate approach offers a linear time complexity of `O(n)`, sidestepping the need for sorting and its associated time cost. This approach is discussed in detail in our [two-sum problem solution](https://interviewing.io/questions/two-sum)\n.\n\nThis example illustrates why it's essential to always consider the impact of sorting on your solution's time complexity. In coding interviews, identifying and articulating these trade-offs is a valuable skill, demonstrating your awareness of performance considerations and your ability to optimize your solutions.\n\n### Not Using Quick Select When Appropriate\n\nAs explained earlier, Quick Select is a selection algorithm to find the `kth` smallest element in an unordered list. It is an in-place variation of the Quick Sort algorithm. Quick Select and its variants are useful for problems where we need to find an order statistic (`kth` smallest or largest element) in an array.\n\nOne common mistake candidates make is resorting to sorting the entire array, which takes `O(n log n)` running time when asked to find an order statistic. Although sorting can make the problem easier to conceptualize, it is often not the most efficient solution. In contrast, Quick Select can find the `kth` smallest or largest element in `O(n)` average time complexity, which is more efficient than sorting for large datasets.\n\nIf you use Priority Queue or a Max Heap to find the `kth` smallest element, the time complexity would be `O(n log k)`, which is better than sorting but still not as efficient as Quick Select.\n\n### Not Using Heap Sort When Appropriate\n\nOne mistake that candidates often make is overlooking the utility of Heap Sort in problem scenarios involving 'Top k' elements of an array. For example, if you are asked to find the 'k' largest elements from an unsorted array, a sorting algorithm like Quick Sort or Merge Sort would take `O(n log n)` time. However, if you use a min heap of size `k` to keep track of the largest elements encountered so far, you can solve the problem in `O(n log k)` time, which is more efficient for large `n` and `k`.\n\nThe choice of sorting algorithm can significantly impact the efficiency of your solution. Let's discuss some scenarios where one algorithm may be preferred over others.\n\n### Not Realizing the Patterns Emerging from a Sorted Array\n\nAnother common mistake candidates make is not recognizing patterns that arise from having a sorted array. These patterns, when identified, can often simplify the problem significantly or make seemingly complex problems more manageable.\n\nOne such pattern is the two-pointer technique, which becomes particularly useful when dealing with sorted arrays. For instance, in the [\"two-sum\"](https://interviewing.io/questions/two-sum)\n problem described in the earlier section, two pointers can find the answer in linear time, making the process much more efficient than other approaches.\n\nAnother pattern emerges as [binary search](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n, a standard tool for efficiently finding an element or determining the insertion position for a new element in a sorted array. Failing to recognize the opportunity to use binary search can result in a significant loss in efficiency. Remembering these patterns when dealing with sorted data is essential, as they can significantly simplify the problem-solving process and increase efficiency.\n\n### Not Considering Counting Sort for Linear Time Complexity\n\nCounting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that can sort elements in linear time given specific conditions. The efficiency of Counting Sort is due to its unique approach, where it does not compare elements but counts the number of distinct elements and their occurrences. This approach allows it to sort the array in `O(n)` time, which is significantly faster than comparison-based sorting algorithms.\n\nThe key to leveraging Counting Sort is recognizing the conditions where it can be applied. It works best when the range of input data (`k`) is not significantly greater than the number of objects (`n`) being sorted. These conditions are often met in problems dealing with small integers, characters, or other discrete types.\n\nHowever, one common mistake candidates make during interviews is not considering Counting Sort when the problem fits its use case. They often resort to more common but less efficient comparison-based sorting algorithms by overlooking the opportunity to use Counting Sort.\n\nFor example, if you have an array of positive integers where the maximum value is not significantly larger than the array's length, Counting Sort could provide a more efficient solution than algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.\n\nRemember, Counting Sort has its limitations—it's not a comparison-based sort, it's not suitable for sorting an extensive range of numbers, and it's not an in-place algorithm. Despite these limitations, when the problem conditions fit its use case, Counting Sort can be an incredibly efficient tool, providing a linear time solution.\n\nWhat to Say in Interviews to Show Mastery Over Sorting\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Understand and Communicate the Complexity of Native Sorting Algorithms\n\nMost programming languages have built-in sorting algorithms, each with unique specifications. Knowledge of these is essential, especially in an interview setting where understanding these subtleties can reflect your command over the language and its features.\n\nLet's consider the default sorting algorithm for three widely used programming languages: Python, Java, and JavaScript:\n\n#### Python's Built-in Sorting Algorithm (Tim Sort)\n\n[Python](https://interviewing.io/python-interview-questions)\n uses [Tim Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort)\n, a hybrid, adaptive sorting algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Tim Sort excels in handling real-world data, and Python's `sort()` function is a practical example of this algorithm. The time complexity is `O(n log n)` in the worst-case scenario, and it is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it maintains the relative order of records with equal keys.\n\nIf you are feeling curious, you can see a [discussion on this topic in Python's source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/listsort.txt)\n.\n\n#### Java's Built-in Sorting Algorithm (Dual-Pivot Quick Sort & Tim Sort)\n\n[Java's](https://interviewing.io/java-interview-questions)\n `Arrays.sort()` method uses [Dual-Pivot Quicksort](https://hg.openjdk.org/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/java/util/DualPivotQuicksort.java)\n for primitive data types, which provides `O(n log n)` performance on many data sets that cause other quicksorts to degrade to quadratic performance. [A modified version of Tim Sort is used for objects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4018332/is-java-7-using-tim-sort-for-the-method-arrays-sort)\n, which also provides `O(n log n)` performance and is stable.\n\n#### JavaScript's Built-in Sorting Algorithm\n\nUnlike Python and Java, [JavaScript's](https://interviewing.io/javascript-interview-questions)\n [`Array.prototype.sort()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort)\n does not specify a particular sorting algorithm to use. Its performance and exact nature can vary across different browsers. Still, most modern browsers, like [Chrome](https://v8.dev/blog/array-sort)\n and Firefox, use a variant of Tim Sort or Quick Sort, both of which have an average time complexity of `O(n log n)`.\n\n#### C++'s Built-in Sorting Algorithm (IntroSort)\n\n[C++'s](https://interviewing.io/cplusplus-interview-questions)\n [`std::sort()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort)\n uses [IntroSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort)\n, a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from Quick Sort and Heap Sort. IntroSort begins with Quick Sort and switches to Heap Sort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on the number of elements being sorted. This makes it a fast sorting algorithm, even on large collections and worst-case scenarios. `std::sort()` has an average and worst-case time complexity of `O(n log n)`. Note that this sorting is not stable, but C++ provides a stable sorting function, `std::stable_sort()`, which has a worst-case time complexity of `O(n log ^ 2n)`.\n\nIn a coding interview, if you use a built-in sorting function, it's worth mentioning to your interviewer that you understand the underlying algorithm and its time complexity. Confirming whether using built-in functions is okay shows your understanding of the language and your care for providing the most optimal solution.\n\n### Ask the Right Questions\n\nIn a coding interview, you are expected to solve the problem and ask the right questions to understand the problem's constraints and requirements thoroughly. This step is crucial when sorting is involved in the problem, as different sorting algorithms have different efficiencies depending on the context. In such cases, you might want to consider asking the following:\n\n_What is the size of the input data?_ This could potentially affect the choice of sorting algorithm, as some algorithms are more efficient with smaller datasets, while others are designed for larger ones.\n\n_What is the nature of the input data?_ Is the data mostly sorted or random? Does the data contain many duplicates? Algorithms like Timsort can take advantage of already sorted data, while algorithms like Quick Sort can struggle with many duplicates.\n\n_What are the memory constraints?_ If memory is limited, an in-place sorting algorithm like Quick Sort could be a better choice over Merge Sort, which requires O(n) additional space.\n\n_Is stability required?_ If yes, you might want to opt for a stable sorting algorithm like Merge Sort or Tim sort over Quick Sort or Heap Sort.\n\n_What are the time complexity requirements?_ If the problem requires a solution with a specific time complexity, it could affect the choice of the sorting algorithm. For example, Radix Sort or Counting Sort might be appropriate for problems requiring linear time complexity and the input data fitting their constraints.\n\nRemember, asking these questions helps you select the most efficient algorithm and shows the interviewer that you understand the impact of different sorting algorithms on a problem's solution. Be sure to vocalize your thought process as you work through these questions and why you chose a specific sorting algorithm based on your answers.\n\n### Discussing Time Complexities of Different Sorting Algorithms\n\nWhen you've identified potential sorting algorithms that could be applied, make it a point to discuss their time complexities with your interviewer. This dialogue isn't just about stating the time complexity of a particular algorithm. It's about understanding and communicating how these complexities would impact the overall performance of your solution, given the specific constraints and requirements of the problem at hand.\n\nFor instance, it's common knowledge that Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort have an average time complexity of `O(n log n)`. However, how would this play out, given the size and nature of the input data? Or, could non-comparison sorts, which can achieve linear time complexity under certain conditions, be a viable option? If so, are there any trade-offs, such as memory usage, to be considered?\n\nBy discussing these complexities and potential trade-offs, you demonstrate a breadth of understanding of sorting algorithms, indicating your ability to make informed decisions based on the specific problem constraints. It showcases your ability to think critically about algorithmic efficiency, a quality highly valued in a software engineer.\n\n### Leverage Non-Comparison Sorts When Appropriate\n\nNon-comparison sorts, such as Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort, can be powerful tools in your algorithmic toolbox, mainly when applied to achieve linear time complexity under the right circumstances. However, these algorithms are only sometimes applicable, so it's essential to understand when to use them and when not to.\n\n#### Counting Sort\n\nCounting sort is an integer sorting algorithm that counts the number of objects with distinct key values. This sort works best when the range of potential items is small relative to the number of items.\n\nFor example, if you have a large number of integers between 1 and 10, counting sort could be very efficient. However, if the integers range from 1 to 1,000,000, counting sort could be infeasible due to memory constraints.\n\n#### Radix Sort\n\nRadix sort operates by sorting numbers digit by digit, from the least significant to the most significant. This sorting algorithm is effective when the numbers to be sorted have the same number of digits.\n\nHowever, if the numbers have varying lengths or are floating-point numbers, radix sort may not be applicable or efficient.\n\n### Bucket Sort\n\nBucket sort works by dividing an array into several buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm.\n\nThis sort is helpful when the input is uniformly distributed over a range but less so if the input data is heavily skewed or has a wide range.\n\nIn a coding interview, demonstrating your understanding of when to use these non-comparison sorts can be a great way to show your depth of knowledge and problem-solving abilities. However, be sure to consider these algorithms' constraints and limitations. For instance, while these algorithms can theoretically achieve linear time complexity, they often require specific conditions and can potentially use significant memory. Be prepared to discuss these trade-offs and why you chose (or chose not to use) a non-comparison sort in your solution.\n\nCommon Sorting interview Questions\n----------------------------------\n\nHARD\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Alien Dictionary](https://interviewing.io/questions/alien-dictionary)\n\n[You are given a list of lexicographically sorted words from an alien language.

Comparison sorts work by comparing elements and deciding their order based on the result; examples are Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort. On the other hand, non-comparison sorts do not make decisions based on comparing elements but on distributing the individual items (e.g., Counting Sort and Radix Sort).\n\nWhile you should know all common sorting algorithms, from a coding interview perspective, you'll see quick sort, merge sort, and heap sort more often than others. Please note that while it's uncommon to be asked to implement these algorithms from scratch in a coding interview, the principles underlying these algorithms often inform the solutions to a variety of complex problems. Therefore, we'll focus on these three algorithms in this section.",

It selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays based on whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.\n\n![Quick Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sorting_1_7518a33da6.gif) _Quick Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)_\n\n**Time Complexity**: The average and best case is `O(n log n)`, but the worst case is `O(n^2)`, when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot.\n\n**Space Complexity**: `O(log n)` due to the stack space during recursive calls.\n\nLet's see its implementation now:\n\nPython\n\n    def quick_sort(arr):\n        quick_sort_helper(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n    \n    def quick_sort_helper(arr, start, end):\n        if start >= end:\n            return\n    \n        pivot_index = partition(arr, start, end)\n        quick_sort_helper(arr, start, pivot_index - 1)\n        quick_sort_helper(arr, pivot_index + 1, end)\n    \n    def partition(arr, start, end):\n        pivot = arr[end]\n        i = start\n        for j in range(start, end):\n            if arr[j] < pivot:\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n                i += 1\n        arr[i], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[i]\n        return i\n    \n\n    1def quick_sort(arr):\n    2    quick_sort_helper(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n    3\n    4def quick_sort_helper(arr, start, end):\n    5    if start >= end:\n    6        return\n    7\n    8    pivot_index = partition(arr, start, end)\n    9    quick_sort_helper(arr, start, pivot_index - 1)\n    10    quick_sort_helper(arr, pivot_index + 1, end)\n    11\n    12def partition(arr, start, end):\n    13    pivot = arr[end]\n    14    i = start\n    15    for j in range(start, end):\n    16        if arr[j] < pivot:\n    17            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    18            i += 1\n    19    arr[i], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[i]\n    20    return i\n    21\n\nIn the provided Python implementation of Quick Sort, the function `quick_sort_helper` serves as the [recursive](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n driver. It divides the array around a pivot, selected as the last element within a particular segment, through the `partition` function. All elements less than the pivot are moved to its left, and those greater to its right, correctly positioning the pivot within the sorted array. The `quick_sort_helper` function then recursively applies this process to the sections on either side of the pivot.",

It divides the unsorted list into N sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Then, it repeatedly merges these sublists to produce new sorted sublists until only one sublist remains.\n\n![Merge Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sorting_2_73b25f5e3e.gif) _Merge Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)_\n\n**Time Complexity**: Merge Sort performs consistently well with a time complexity of `O(n log n)` in all cases.\n\n**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, as it requires auxiliary space to store the temporary arrays.\n\nLet's look at some example code:\n\nPython\n\n    def merge_sort(arr):\n        # base case\n        if len(arr) <= 1:\n            return arr\n    \n        # divide the array into two halves\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n        left = arr[:mid]\n        right = arr[mid:]\n    \n        # sort each half\n        return merge(merge_sort(left), merge_sort(right))\n    \n    def merge(left, right):\n        result = []\n        i = j = 0\n    \n        # merge the two arrays together\n        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n            if left[i] < right[j]:\n                result.append(left[i])\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                result.append(right[j])\n                j += 1\n    \n        # add any remaining elements\n        result.extend(left[i:])\n        result.extend(right[j:])\n        return result\n\n    1def merge_sort(arr):\n    2    # base case\n    3    if len(arr) <= 1:\n    4        return arr\n    5\n    6    # divide the array into two halves\n    7    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    8    left = arr[:mid]\n    9    right = arr[mid:]\n    10\n    11    # sort each half\n    12    return merge(merge_sort(left), merge_sort(right))\n    13\n    14def merge(left, right):\n    15    result = []\n    16    i = j = 0\n    17\n    18    # merge the two arrays together\n    19    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n    20        if left[i] < right[j]:\n    21            result.append(left[i])\n    22            i += 1\n    23        else:\n    24            result.append(right[j])\n    25            j += 1\n    26\n    27    # add any remaining elements\n    28    result.extend(left[i:])\n    29    result.extend(right[j:])\n    30    return result\n\nHere, the function `merge_sort` acts as the primary function, dividing the array into two halves recursively until a base case of a single element array is achieved.\n\nOnce the array is broken down, the merge function combines these halves back together in sorted order. The merge function initiates by comparing elements at the start of the left and right arrays, appending the smaller one to the `result` array. This process continues until one array is exhausted, after which any remaining elements from the non-empty array are appended to the `result`.\n\nMerge Sort is particularly effective for sorting [linked lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n. This is because linked lists have slow access times but efficient insertion and deletion operations. Merge Sort is very efficient with sequential access data like linked lists, and it doesn't require random access to data.",

A binary heap is a complete binary tree, which can be either a max heap or a min-heap. In a max heap, the parent node is always larger than or equal to its children, while in a min-heap, the parent node is less than or equal to its children. The binary heap data structure lets us quickly access the largest (max heap) or smallest (min-heap) element.\n\nHeap Sort first builds a max heap from the input data, then continuously removes the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the sorted array.\n\n![Heap Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sorting_3_03129bf773.gif) _Heap Sort in Action (Credit - Wikipedia)_\n\n**Time Complexity**: Heap Sort performs consistently with a time complexity of `O(n log n)` in all cases.\n\n**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as it does not require extra space beyond what is needed to store the input.\n\nThe following code shows how to implement Heap Sort:\n\nPython\n\n    import heapq\n    \n    def heap_sort(arr):\n        heapq.heapify(arr)\n        sorted_arr = []\n        while arr:\n            sorted_arr.append(heapq.heappop(arr))\n        return sorted_arr\n    \n    \n    # Note\n    # We use Python's built-in heapq module to implement Heap Sort.

          "content": "### Stability of Sorting Algorithms\n\nImagine you're at a library, organizing books on a shelf. You might first arrange them alphabetically by the author's last name. But then, you notice several books by the same author. To make it easier for readers, you decide to sort these books by publication year. However, you wouldn't want this secondary sort to mix up the primary alphabetical order you've already established. This is the essence of a \"stable\" sort in computer science.\n\nIn more technical terms, a sorting algorithm is \"stable\" if it maintains the original order of equal elements in the sorted output. Think of it like sorting a deck of cards. Let's say you first sort them by number. Next, you decide to sort by suit—clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. A stable sort ensures that the '2' of clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades maintain their original order even after the suit sort.\n\nThis characteristic is not just a theoretical concept but has practical implications in various real-world scenarios. Consider sorting entries in a database—preserving the original order of entries with the same key can be critical.\n\n![Relative ordering is preserved in a stable sort of elements](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sorting_4_957006e469.png)\n\nAs a developer, you'll encounter both stable and unstable sorting algorithms. For example, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort are stable sorting algorithms preserving the original order. In contrast, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort are not—they might mix up the original order of equal elements. Therefore, understanding the stability of a sorting algorithm is crucial when choosing the right one for your task.",

These algorithms are beneficial when memory usage is a concern, as they don't require additional storage proportional to the input size.\n\nQuick Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort are examples of in-place sorting algorithms, while Merge Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort require additional space, so they are not in-place.",

Partitioning is a fundamental operation in Quick Sort and can be used to solve these types of problems efficiently.\n\nHere's an example of a problem: [Given an array, move all the negative elements to one side of the array](https://interviewing.io/questions/partition-list)\n.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the partitioning logic from quick sort:\n\nPython\n\n    def rearrange_elements(arr):\n        pivot = 0  # partition around 0 for positive/negative segregation\n        i = -1\n        for j in range(len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] < pivot:\n                i += 1\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        return arr\n    \n    print(rearrange_elements([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, -7]))\n    # Output: [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 2]\n\n    1def rearrange_elements(arr):\n    2    pivot = 0  # partition around 0 for positive/negative segregation\n    3    i = -1\n    4    for j in range(len(arr)):\n    5        if arr[j] < pivot:\n    6            i += 1\n    7            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    8    return arr\n    9\n    10print(rearrange_elements([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, -7]))\n    11# Output: [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 2]\n\nIn the code above, we initialize `i` as -1 and iterate over the array. Whenever we find a negative element, we increment `i` and swap the current element with the element at index `i`. This pushes all negative elements towards the front of the array (or left side if visualized as a line).\n\nUnderstanding partitioning and how it segregates data based on a condition helps solve a broad range of problems, and it is a typical pattern in many coding interview questions.",

          "content": "### Selection Problems\n\nSelection problems often involve finding the `k`th smallest or largest element in an array. These problems can take advantage of the selection algorithm used in Quick Sort or Heap Sort. Both methods have their strengths and are suited to different situations. Understanding the difference can lead to more efficient solutions and exhibit your algorithmic knowledge in interviews.\n\nFor instance, let's consider the problem of finding the `k`th largest element in an unsorted array.\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to sort the array and then index the `k`th largest element. While this method works, it can be inefficient, especially with large arrays, as the time complexity of sorting is `O(n log n)`.\n\nPython\n\n    def kth_largest(nums, k):\n        nums.sort(reverse=True)\n        return nums[k-1]\n    \n\n    1def kth_largest(nums, k):\n    2    nums.sort(reverse=True)\n    3    return nums[k-1]\n    4\n\n#### Heap Based Solution\n\nA more optimal solution than naive sorting involves using a min-heap of size `k`. This reduces the time complexity to `O(n log k)`, which is better when `k` is significantly smaller than `n`.\n\nPython\n\n    import heapq\n    \n    def kth_largest(nums, k):\n        heap = []\n        for num in nums:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, num)\n            if len(heap) > k:\n                heapq.heappop(heap)\n        return heapq.heappop(heap)\n    \n\n    1import heapq\n    2\n    3def kth_largest(nums, k):\n    4    heap = []\n    5    for num in nums:\n    6        heapq.heappush(heap, num)\n    7        if len(heap) > k:\n    8            heapq.heappop(heap)\n    9    return heapq.heappop(heap)\n    10\n\nIn this code, we're maintaining a min heap of size `k`, where the root of the heap is the `k`th largest element so far. We iterate over each element in the array, and for each element, we add it to the heap and remove the smallest element if the heap size exceeds `k`. By the end of the iteration, the root of the heap is our desired `k`th largest element.\n\n#### QuickSelect Based Solution\n\nThe QuickSelect algorithm is another method that can be used to solve selection problems more efficiently. This algorithm, a derivative of the Quick Sort algorithm, uses partitioning to find the `k`th smallest or largest element in an unsorted list.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the QuickSelect algorithm to find the `k`th largest element:\n\nPython\n\n    def partition(nums, low, high):\n        # Choose rightmost as pivot\n        pivot = nums[high]\n        i = low\n        for j in range(low, high)\n            # Partition array\n            if nums[j] <= pivot:\n                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]\n                i += 1\n    \n        # Finalize pivot position\n        nums[i], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[i]\n        return i\n    \n    def quick_select(nums, low, high, k):\n        if low == high:\n            # Single element base case\n            return nums[low]\n        \n        # Find pivot index\n        pivot_index = partition(nums, low, high)\n        if k == pivot_index:\n            # Pivot matches k\n            return nums[k]\n        elif k < pivot_index:\n            # Recurse on left partition\n            return quick_select(nums, low, pivot_index - 1, k)\n        else:\n            # Recurse on right partition\n            return quick_select(nums, pivot_index + 1, high, k)\n    \n    def kth_largest(nums, k):\n        # Translate kth largest to kth smallest\n        return quick_select(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, len(nums) - k) \n    \n\n    1def partition(nums, low, high):\n    2    # Choose rightmost as pivot\n    3    pivot = nums[high]\n    4    i = low\n    5    for j in range(low, high)\n    6        # Partition array\n    7        if nums[j] <= pivot:\n    8            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]\n    9            i += 1\n    10\n    11    # Finalize pivot position\n    12    nums[i], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[i]\n    13    return i\n    14\n    15def quick_select(nums, low, high, k):\n    16    if low == high:\n    17        # Single element base case\n    18        return nums[low]\n    19    \n    20    # Find pivot index\n    21    pivot_index = partition(nums, low, high)\n    22    if k == pivot_index:\n    23        # Pivot matches k\n    24        return nums[k]\n    25    elif k < pivot_index:\n    26        # Recurse on left partition\n    27        return quick_select(nums, low, pivot_index - 1, k)\n    28    else:\n    29        # Recurse on right partition\n    30        return quick_select(nums, pivot_index + 1, high, k)\n    31\n    32def kth_largest(nums, k):\n    33    # Translate kth largest to kth smallest\n    34    return quick_select(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, len(nums) - k) \n    35\n\nThe QuickSelect algorithm can solve the problem in `O(n)` time on average, although the worst-case scenario can be `O(n^2)` when the pivot is the smallest or largest element in the list. However, the worst case is highly unlikely if we randomly select a pivot.\n\nComparing this with the heap-based solution, the heap-based solution has a time complexity of `O(n log k)`. The heap-based solution could be more efficient for very large `n` and small `k`. However, if `k` is relatively close to `n`, QuickSelect's `O(n)` average time complexity can be more efficient. Therefore, it's essential to understand these time complexities and the nature of the problem to select the most efficient solution in a coding interview.\n\nYou can see a detailed discussion on [how to find `k`th smallest element here](https://interviewing.io/questions/kth-smallest-element)\n.",

These problems can take advantage of the merging step in `MergeSort`. By understanding the merge operation, you can solve a range of problems that involve merging more efficiently.\n\nFor instance, a classic problem is \"Merge Intervals\". Given a collection of intervals, merge any overlapping intervals.\n\nA naive approach to this problem would involve comparing each interval with every other interval, leading to a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.\n\nHowever, by sorting the intervals and then merging, we can solve this problem in `O(n log n)` time.\n\nHere's an example solution in Python:\n\nPython\n\n    def merge_intervals(intervals):\n        if not intervals:\n            return []\n        # sort the intervals based on the start time\n        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        merged = [intervals[0]]\n        for current in intervals:\n            # compare the current interval with the last merged interval\n            last = merged[-1]\n            if current[0] <= last[1]:\n                # if they overlap, merge them by updating the end of the last interval\n                last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])\n            else:\n                # if they do not overlap, add the current interval to the merged list\n                merged.append(current)\n        return merged\n    \n\n    1def merge_intervals(intervals):\n    2    if not intervals:\n    3        return []\n    4    # sort the intervals based on the start time\n    5    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    6    merged = [intervals[0]]\n    7    for current in intervals:\n    8        # compare the current interval with the last merged interval\n    9        last = merged[-1]\n    10        if current[0] <= last[1]:\n    11            # if they overlap, merge them by updating the end of the last interval\n    12            last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])\n    13        else:\n    14            # if they do not overlap, add the current interval to the merged list\n    15            merged.append(current)\n    16    return merged\n    17\n\nWe first sort the intervals in the above code based on their start time. We then iterate over the sorted intervals and merge them if they overlap or add them to the result list if they do not.\n\nUnderstanding merge operations helps deal with problems involving sorted arrays or lists and demonstrates your ability to leverage sorting techniques to simplify complex problems during coding interviews.",

          "content": "### Using Custom Comparators\n\nBuilding upon the concept in the last section, a critical aspect that plays an integral role in various sorting-related problems, especially in languages that support it, is custom comparators. A custom comparator is a function that we provide to the sorting function, dictating the sorting order beyond natural ordering.\n\nWe used a custom comparator in the merge intervals problem we discussed: `key=lambda x: x[0]`. The `key` function provided to the sort method determines the attribute upon which the list is sorted. Here, we instruct Python to sort the `intervals` array by the first element of each interval. This allows us to sort the intervals by their start times, enabling us to handle overlaps more efficiently.\n\nThe `sort` method uses the return value of the comparator function to decide the order of elements. If for two intervals `a` and `b`, `a[0]` (the start time of `a`) is less than `b[0]` (the start time of `b`), `a` will come before `b` in the sorted list. Conversely, if `a[0]` is greater than `b[0]`, `a` will come after `b` in the sorted list. If both are equal, then the original order is preserved because Python's sort is stable. If we want to sort in descending order, we can simply reverse the comparison: `key=lambda x: -x[0]`.\n\nUnderstanding and correctly using custom comparators shows your grasp on sorting algorithms and indicates your ability to leverage language-specific features to solve complex problems.\n\nBelow, we show an example code of how to use custom comparators with Python, Java, and JavaScript.\n\nPythonJavaJavaScript\n\n    # Sorting an array of tuples based on the second element\n    arr = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 3)]\n    # We use the `key` argument in the `sort` method to provide a custom comparator\n    arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    print(arr)  # Output: [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]\n\n    1# Sorting an array of tuples based on the second element\n    2arr = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 3)]\n    3# We use the `key` argument in the `sort` method to provide a custom comparator\n    4arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    5print(arr)  # Output: [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]",

The idea is to divide the data into chunks that can fit into memory, sort these chunks separately, and then merge them.\n\nAn instance of a problem that might require external sorting is when you're given a massive log file (several gigabytes) and asked to sort the entries by timestamp. Trying to load the entire file into memory would likely be impractical, if not impossible, given the limitations of your computer's memory.\n\nA typical approach to this problem would be to use a divide-and-conquer strategy similar to Merge Sort:\n\n1.  Divide the log file into smaller chunks that fit into memory.\n2.  Sort each chunk separately.\n3.  Merge the sorted chunks.\n\nThis merging step can be accomplished using a [priority queue](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions#advanced-queue-structures-priority-queues)\n (min-heap), which always pops the smallest element. The priority queue should be initialized with the smallest element from each chunk. Each time an element is popped from the priority queue, we push the next element from the same chunk into the queue.\n\nWhile it's rare to ask candidates to write a complete external sorting algorithm during an interview due to its complexity, the concept could come up in [system design interviews](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview/part-two)\n or discussions about handling large data sets. Understanding this concept would demonstrate your knowledge of handling and processing large data.\n\n(Note: Actual implementation of an external sort in a coding interview is rare, and most languages or databases offer built-in functionality for handling this sort of problem. However, it's important to understand the principles behind it.)",

          "content": "### Enhancing the Efficiency of Solutions\n\nIn many coding interview problems, the key to creating an efficient solution often lies in pre-processing the input data. Sorting is one of the most common pre-processing steps that can significantly enhance the efficiency of your solution. This is because operations like searching for elements, finding minimum or maximum elements, and comparing elements can be done much faster on sorted data.\n\nConsider a problem where you are asked to [find a pair of elements in an array that sum up to a target value](https://interviewing.io/questions/two-sum)\n. A brute force solution would involve a nested loop, comparing each element with every other element, leading to a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.\n\nHowever, by sorting the array first, we can use a [two-pointer approach](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n where one pointer starts from the beginning and the other starts from the end. We then move the pointers inward until they meet, effectively searching the array in `O(n)` time. This reduces the total time complexity to `O(n log n)` for sorting plus `O(n)` for searching, significantly improving the brute force approach.\n\nPython\n\n    def two_sum(nums, target):\n        nums.sort()\n        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n        while left < right:\n            current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]\n            if current_sum == target:\n                return [nums[left], nums[right]]\n            elif current_sum < target:\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                right -= 1\n        return []\n    \n    print(two_sum([3,5,2,8,1], 10))  # Output: [2, 8]\n\n    1def two_sum(nums, target):\n    2    nums.sort()\n    3    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    4    while left < right:\n    5        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]\n    6        if current_sum == target:\n    7            return [nums[left], nums[right]]\n    8        elif current_sum < target:\n    9            left += 1\n    10        else:\n    11            right -= 1\n    12    return []\n    13\n    14print(two_sum([3,5,2,8,1], 10))  # Output: [2, 8]\n\nIn this example, sorting the array first allows us to search for the pair in linear time, significantly improving the efficiency of our solution.\n\nAnother scenario where sorting improves efficiency is when binary search is applied. Sorting the data allows binary search to work, reducing search time from `O(n)` in a linear search to `O(log n)`. You can check our detailed guide on [binary search](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n for a more in-depth understanding and application in interview scenarios.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that understanding how sorting can be used to enhance the efficiency of your solutions will enable you to solve problems more effectively in coding interviews.",

A common pitfall is overlooking the added time complexity of sorting when used in a solution.\n\nFor instance, consider the [two-sum problem](https://interviewing.io/questions/two-sum)\n discussed earlier, where we find a pair in an array that adds up to a particular target value. In a previously discussed approach, we used sorting and two-pointers. This approach does yield correct results; however, the sorting step adds significant time complexity.\n\nThe sort operation itself has a time complexity of `O(n log n)`, which might overshadow the subsequent two-pointer traversal of the array that only takes `O(n)` time. If `n` is large, this increased time complexity due to sorting could significantly affect the performance of your solution.\n\nWhile the sort and two-pointer method is valid, a more time-efficient solution exists. Using a hash map to track the elements you've encountered as you traverse the array, you can check if the complement to the target value has already been seen in constant time. This alternate approach offers a linear time complexity of `O(n)`, sidestepping the need for sorting and its associated time cost. This approach is discussed in detail in our [two-sum problem solution](https://interviewing.io/questions/two-sum)\n.\n\nThis example illustrates why it's essential to always consider the impact of sorting on your solution's time complexity.

          "content": "### Not Considering Counting Sort for Linear Time Complexity\n\nCounting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that can sort elements in linear time given specific conditions. The efficiency of Counting Sort is due to its unique approach, where it does not compare elements but counts the number of distinct elements and their occurrences. This approach allows it to sort the array in `O(n)` time, which is significantly faster than comparison-based sorting algorithms.\n\nThe key to leveraging Counting Sort is recognizing the conditions where it can be applied. It works best when the range of input data (`k`) is not significantly greater than the number of objects (`n`) being sorted. These conditions are often met in problems dealing with small integers, characters, or other discrete types.\n\nHowever, one common mistake candidates make during interviews is not considering Counting Sort when the problem fits its use case. They often resort to more common but less efficient comparison-based sorting algorithms by overlooking the opportunity to use Counting Sort.\n\nFor example, if you have an array of positive integers where the maximum value is not significantly larger than the array's length, Counting Sort could provide a more efficient solution than algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.\n\nRemember, Counting Sort has its limitations—it's not a comparison-based sort, it's not suitable for sorting an extensive range of numbers, and it's not an in-place algorithm. Despite these limitations, when the problem conditions fit its use case, Counting Sort can be an incredibly efficient tool, providing a linear time solution.\n\nWhat to Say in Interviews to Show Mastery Over Sorting\n------------------------------------------------------",

          "content": "### Understand and Communicate the Complexity of Native Sorting Algorithms\n\nMost programming languages have built-in sorting algorithms, each with unique specifications. Knowledge of these is essential, especially in an interview setting where understanding these subtleties can reflect your command over the language and its features.\n\nLet's consider the default sorting algorithm for three widely used programming languages: Python, Java, and JavaScript:\n\n#### Python's Built-in Sorting Algorithm (Tim Sort)\n\n[Python](https://interviewing.io/python-interview-questions)\n uses [Tim Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort)\n, a hybrid, adaptive sorting algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Tim Sort excels in handling real-world data, and Python's `sort()` function is a practical example of this algorithm. The time complexity is `O(n log n)` in the worst-case scenario, and it is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it maintains the relative order of records with equal keys.\n\nIf you are feeling curious, you can see a [discussion on this topic in Python's source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/listsort.txt)\n.\n\n#### Java's Built-in Sorting Algorithm (Dual-Pivot Quick Sort & Tim Sort)\n\n[Java's](https://interviewing.io/java-interview-questions)\n `Arrays.sort()` method uses [Dual-Pivot Quicksort](https://hg.openjdk.org/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/java/util/DualPivotQuicksort.java)\n for primitive data types, which provides `O(n log n)` performance on many data sets that cause other quicksorts to degrade to quadratic performance. [A modified version of Tim Sort is used for objects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4018332/is-java-7-using-tim-sort-for-the-method-arrays-sort)\n, which also provides `O(n log n)` performance and is stable.\n\n#### JavaScript's Built-in Sorting Algorithm\n\nUnlike Python and Java, [JavaScript's](https://interviewing.io/javascript-interview-questions)\n [`Array.prototype.sort()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort)\n does not specify a particular sorting algorithm to use. Its performance and exact nature can vary across different browsers. Still, most modern browsers, like [Chrome](https://v8.dev/blog/array-sort)\n and Firefox, use a variant of Tim Sort or Quick Sort, both of which have an average time complexity of `O(n log n)`.\n\n#### C++'s Built-in Sorting Algorithm (IntroSort)\n\n[C++'s](https://interviewing.io/cplusplus-interview-questions)\n [`std::sort()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort)\n uses [IntroSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort)\n, a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from Quick Sort and Heap Sort. IntroSort begins with Quick Sort and switches to Heap Sort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on the number of elements being sorted. This makes it a fast sorting algorithm, even on large collections and worst-case scenarios. `std::sort()` has an average and worst-case time complexity of `O(n log n)`. Note that this sorting is not stable, but C++ provides a stable sorting function, `std::stable_sort()`, which has a worst-case time complexity of `O(n log ^ 2n)`.\n\nIn a coding interview, if you use a built-in sorting function, it's worth mentioning to your interviewer that you understand the underlying algorithm and its time complexity. Confirming whether using built-in functions is okay shows your understanding of the language and your care for providing the most optimal solution.",

This step is crucial when sorting is involved in the problem, as different sorting algorithms have different efficiencies depending on the context. In such cases, you might want to consider asking the following:\n\n_What is the size of the input data?_ This could potentially affect the choice of sorting algorithm, as some algorithms are more efficient with smaller datasets, while others are designed for larger ones.\n\n_What is the nature of the input data?_ Is the data mostly sorted or random? Does the data contain many duplicates? Algorithms like Timsort can take advantage of already sorted data, while algorithms like Quick Sort can struggle with many duplicates.\n\n_What are the memory constraints?_ If memory is limited, an in-place sorting algorithm like Quick Sort could be a better choice over Merge Sort, which requires O(n) additional space.\n\n_Is stability required?_ If yes, you might want to opt for a stable sorting algorithm like Merge Sort or Tim sort over Quick Sort or Heap Sort.\n\n_What are the time complexity requirements?_ If the problem requires a solution with a specific time complexity, it could affect the choice of the sorting algorithm. For example, Radix Sort or Counting Sort might be appropriate for problems requiring linear time complexity and the input data fitting their constraints.\n\nRemember, asking these questions helps you select the most efficient algorithm and shows the interviewer that you understand the impact of different sorting algorithms on a problem's solution. Be sure to vocalize your thought process as you work through these questions and why you chose a specific sorting algorithm based on your answers.",

This dialogue isn't just about stating the time complexity of a particular algorithm. It's about understanding and communicating how these complexities would impact the overall performance of your solution, given the specific constraints and requirements of the problem at hand.\n\nFor instance, it's common knowledge that Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort have an average time complexity of `O(n log n)`. However, how would this play out, given the size and nature of the input data? Or, could non-comparison sorts, which can achieve linear time complexity under certain conditions, be a viable option? If so, are there any trade-offs, such as memory usage, to be considered?\n\nBy discussing these complexities and potential trade-offs, you demonstrate a breadth of understanding of sorting algorithms, indicating your ability to make informed decisions based on the specific problem constraints.

However, these algorithms are only sometimes applicable, so it's essential to understand when to use them and when not to.\n\n#### Counting Sort\n\nCounting sort is an integer sorting algorithm that counts the number of objects with distinct key values. This sort works best when the range of potential items is small relative to the number of items.\n\nFor example, if you have a large number of integers between 1 and 10, counting sort could be very efficient. However, if the integers range from 1 to 1,000,000, counting sort could be infeasible due to memory constraints.\n\n#### Radix Sort\n\nRadix sort operates by sorting numbers digit by digit, from the least significant to the most significant. This sorting algorithm is effective when the numbers to be sorted have the same number of digits.\n\nHowever, if the numbers have varying lengths or are floating-point numbers, radix sort may not be applicable or efficient.",

Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm.\n\nThis sort is helpful when the input is uniformly distributed over a range but less so if the input data is heavily skewed or has a wide range.\n\nIn a coding interview, demonstrating your understanding of when to use these non-comparison sorts can be a great way to show your depth of knowledge and problem-solving abilities. However, be sure to consider these algorithms' constraints and limitations. For instance, while these algorithms can theoretically achieve linear time complexity, they often require specific conditions and can potentially use significant memory.

The key characteristic is the way dynamic programming breaks the overall problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems. Often the solutions to subproblems are stored and reused to avoid repeated work. In comparison with other approaches, this greatly improves the efficiency of the solution.\n\nCompanies That Ask Dynamic Programming Questions\n------------------------------------------------\n\n[![Google](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgoogle_com_128x128_2818837343.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Google](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Watch 40  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=google)\n\n[![Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fmicrosoft_com_128x128_e8c2de6d0b.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Watch 24  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=microsoft)\n\n[![Apple](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fapple_com_128x128_61116200e1.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Apple](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=apple)\n\nA Practical Example: Determining the Nth Fibonacci Number\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo quickly refresh your memory, the Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers in which every number is the sum of the two previous numbers:\n\n    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, …\n    \n\nWe should also restate that the Fibonacci sequence is known to start with 0, 1. This represents the \"base case\" which will be covered in more detail later on.\n\nNow, looking from left-to-right, it is fairly easy to see that each number, along with its predecessor, is needed to determine the next in the sequence. Think of this as a “bottom-up” approach in that it begins with the first example and builds up to the desired solution.\n\nSaid another way, and this time looking from right-to-left, a given number in the sequence can be derived from the two previous numbers. Think of this as a \"top-down\" approach in that it begins with the desired solution and drills down toward the first example.\n\nRegardless of which way you look at it, the computation can be formalized as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). This is known as a recurrence relation and is another important concept that we’ll get back to later.\n\nLet’s now turn to some code and step through a simple top-down solution that makes use of [recursion](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n:\n\nPython\n\n    def fib(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)\n\n    1def fib(n):\n    2    if n == 0:\n    3        return 0\n    4    if n == 1:\n    5        return 1\n    6    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)\n\nConsider what happens when invoked as `fib(5)` to determine the fourth Fibonacci number.\n\n`N - 1 = 4` and `N - 2 = 3` so this function makes recursive calls to `return fib(4) + fib(3)`. Notice that the invocation of `fib(4)` will in turn make recursive calls `fib(3)` and `fib(2)`. This highlights the overlapping subproblems and where work is being repeated. The function calls can also be represented as a tree to visualize and identify the repeated work:\n\n![An image showing the repeated work when solving nth Fibonacci recursively.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dynamic_programming_fibonnaci_repeated_work_30ff271031.png?updated_at=2023-06-30T15:57:14.215Z)\n\nIn the end, solving for the fifth Fibonacci number ends up solving for:\n\n*   The fourth Fibonacci number once\n*   The third number twice\n*   The second number three times\n*   The first number five times\n\nThis is where dynamic programming really shines as it helps avoid repeating work and provides a far more efficient solution.\n\n#### Incorporating Memoization to Avoid Repeated Work\n\nIn the recursive algorithm for this problem the answer to `fib(3)` (and all other subproblems) is immediately discarded; what a waste!\n\nInstead, we can utilize a hashmap to store the return value of `fib(3)` and later when the same subproblem comes up, the result can be quickly retrieved, with O(1) time complexity, instead of repeating it all over. Summing two numbers a handful of times for low values of N may not seem like a big deal, but as N gets subproblem repetition increases rapidly. This technique of caching the result of a function call, in order to avoid making the same call again in future, is known as [memoization](https://interviewing.io/memoization-interview-questions)\n.\n\nPython\n\n    def topDownFib(n):\n        dp = [0] * (n+1)\n        return topDownFibHelper(n, dp)\n    \n    def topDownFibHelper(n, dp):\n        if n == 0 or n == 1:\n            return n\n        # If value is not set in cache, compute it\n        if dp[n] == 0:\n            dp[n] = topDownFibHelper(n-1, dp) + topDownFibHelper(n-2, dp)\n        return dp[n]\n    \n\n    1def topDownFib(n):\n    2    dp = [0] * (n+1)\n    3    return topDownFibHelper(n, dp)\n    4\n    5def topDownFibHelper(n, dp):\n    6    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n    7        return n\n    8    # If value is not set in cache, compute it\n    9    if dp[n] == 0:\n    10        dp[n] = topDownFibHelper(n-1, dp) + topDownFibHelper(n-2, dp)\n    11    return dp[n]\n    12\n\n#### Working Iteratively from the Bottom Up Using Tabulation\n\nSimilarly, this problem can be solved from the bottom up, calculating and storing each number in the sequence along the way. This style of storing and reusing results is known as “tabulation”.\n\nPython\n\n    def bottomUpFib(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        # Initialize cache\n        dp = [0] * (n+1)\n        dp[1] = 1\n     \n        # Fill cache iteratively\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\n            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n        \n        return dp[n]\n    \n\n    1def bottomUpFib(n):\n    2    if n == 0:\n    3        return 0\n    4    # Initialize cache\n    5    dp = [0] * (n+1)\n    6    dp[1] = 1\n    7 \n    8    # Fill cache iteratively\n    9    for i in range(2, n+1):\n    10        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n    11    \n    12    return dp[n]\n    13\n\nAlthough an array can be used for tabulation when solving for Fibonacci (and in fact is excessive since at most 2 previous previous results are ever needed), it demonstrates a concept that often needs to be extended as far as using multi-dimensional arrays to solve more complex problems.\n\n#### A Quick Recap on What We Learned via Fibonacci\n\nAfter considering Fibonacci from different perspectives and seeing two contrasting approaches, we’ve now been introduced to all the core concepts associated with dynamic programming:\n\n1.  Base cases and the sub-problems that give light to a recurrence relation\n2.  Top-down approaches which typically involve recursion and memoization\n3.  Bottom-up approaches that are usually iterative and use tabulation\n\nLet’s move on to look at when and how to apply Dynamic programming in interviews.\n\nUsing Dynamic Programming in Interviews\n---------------------------------------\n\nBefore getting to the more formal concepts that determine whether dynamic programming can be applied, let's look at some basic heuristics to use in an interview to determine whether to even consider dynamic programming.\n\n### Heuristics for Identifying Dynamic Programming Problems\n\nThe first heuristic comes from considering the problem statement. Does it ask for the min/max out of a set of possible options, the best/worst of a set of possible options, or perhaps the total number of options? This isn't confirmation that dynamic programming is suitable, or even that's the best approach, but it is a good signal that DP is worth exploring.\n\nAs always in a technical interview, it's good practice to discuss and work through one or two simple-ish examples. Doing so helps to clarify the interviewer's requirements and expectations, plus it provides test cases for later. While working through the examples you likely identified a brute-force approach. And in explaining how the brute force work leads to the result, did you find yourself mentioning that the more complex example \"follows on from\" or \"makes use of\" the simpler example? This is a second heuristic and it's a great indication that there are sub-problems and repeated work which means a dynamic programming approach could work well.\n\nDoes a programmatic solution involving recursion become apparent? Where does the recursion lead? Eventually it must \"bottom out\" and this is likely to be the base case. What are the branches or conditional paths that trigger recursive calls? They will likely form part of the recurrence relation. The availability of a recursive solution is a third heuristic you can look for.\n\nWith one or more of these heuristics present, you can be confident spending time and looking hard for a dynamic programming solution.\n\n### Optimal Substructure and Overlapping Subproblems\n\nMore formally, in order to apply dynamic programming to a problem two conditions must be present:\n\n1.  Optimal substructure\n2.  Overlapping subproblems\n\n#### Optimal Substructure\n\nOptimal substructure requires that you can solve a problem based on the solutions of subproblems. For example, if you want to calculate the 5th Fibonacci number, it can be solved by computing fib(5) = fib(4) + fib(3). It is not necessary to know any more information other than the solutions of those two subproblems in order to determine the solution.\n\nA useful way to think about optimal substructure is whether a problem can be easily solved recursively. Recursive solutions inherently solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. If you can solve a problem recursively, it most likely has an optimal substructure.\n\n#### Overlapping Subproblems\n\nOverlapping subproblems means that when you split your problem into subproblems, you sometimes get the same subproblem multiple times. With the Fibonacci example, if we want to compute `fib(5)`, we need to compute `fib(4)` and `fib(3)`. However, to compute `fib(4)`, we need to compute `fib(3)` again. This is a wasted effort, since we’ve already computed the value of `fib(3)`.\n\nDynamic programming relies on overlapping subproblems, and it uses memory to save the values that have already been computed to avoid computing them again. The more overlap there is, the more computational time is saved.\n\n### The FAST Method\n\n**FAST** is an acronym that stands for **F**ind the first solution, **A**nalyze the solution, identify the **S**ubproblems, and **T**urn around the solution.\n\nIt isn’t the only way to work through problems to reach a dynamic programming solution, but aims to be easy to remember and apply while being broadly applicable.\n\nLet’s break down each of these steps.\n\n#### Find the First Solution\n\nThe first step to solving any dynamic programming problem using The FAST Method is to find an initial brute force recursive solution. Solve the problem without concern for efficiency, just as a starting point. Though there are a couple of constraints on how this brute force solution should look:\n\n*   **Recursive functions should be self-contained.** Storing results by updating global variables may make it impossible to introduce memoization later on. Craft a function that is solely dependent on its parameters and not affected by outside factors.\n    \n*   **Avoid unnecessary recursive function arguments.** Subproblem results will eventually be memoized based on the arguments; the fewer the better.\n    \n\n#### Analyze the First Solution\n\nAnalyze the initial brute force solution. This involves determining the time and space complexity and determining if there are any obvious areas for improvement.\n\nAs part of the analytical process, confirm that the first solution fits the rules for problems with Dynamic programming solutions:\n\n*   Does it have an optimal substructure?\n*   Are there overlapping subproblems?\n\n#### Subproblem Identification\n\nIf there is indeed a Dynamic programming solution, the appropriate subproblems can now be identified and coded. Apply memoization to avoid unnecessary repeated work. At this point the problem is solved with a top-down solution that likely exhibits optimal complexity and no does not repeat any work.\n\n#### Turn the Solution Around\n\nSince we understand the problem well, we can go further. This involves coding the alternate bottom-up approach that iteratively computes and uses tabulation to store the results of successive subproblems, until the overall solution is reached. Turning the solution to bottom-up is generally desired as it avoids pitfalls associated with recursion and the call stack.\n\n### Deciding on Top-down/Memoization vs. Bottom-up/Tabulation\n\nIn an interview, the choice of top-down or bottom-up approaches should be balanced with other factors beyond performance: How easily can the bottom-up solution be coded, is it as easily reasoned about and discussed with the interviewer? Which approach are you most comfortable with? That may be the most important factor of all!\n\nCommon Mistakes in Interviews Featuring Dynamic Programming\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Jumping too quickly to conclude dynamic programming is necessary**. When you have a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. If the problem doesn’t require an optimal solution but rather any correct solution, a greedy approach will likely be simpler to identify and implement.\n    \n2.  **Conversely, looking too hard for a greedy solution and failing to recognize a dynamic programming problem.** A way to determine which solution is more appropriate is to know whether a sub-solution helps lead to the final solution. If a sub-solution (a solution with a part of the input) helps, then dynamic programming is probably the way to go!\n    \n3.  **Failing to identify how to break the problem into subproblems so that the recurrence relation and base case(s) become clear.** When you have a strong intuition (or have been told) that a problem needs a Dynamic programming solution, this is the major challenge. Reviewing plenty of questions and gaining practice is essential.\n    \n4.  **Struggling to define and work with a suitable result matrix.** Many problems (such as Longest Common Subsequence) involve two- or multi-dimensional arrays to store sub-problem results. These can be difficult to conceive and may be tricky to work with in code. Again it’s all about practice.\n    \n\n![Diagramming a multi-dimenisional array used for tabulation.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dynamic_programming_tabulation_5ca70457ee.png?updated_at=2023-06-30T15:59:29.606Z)\n\n5.  Lack of clarity in communicating your dynamic programming logic. Visualizations can help a great deal here. As we’ve seen in this article, sketching a recursive tree or a matrix table can be helpful tools to gain shared understanding with your interviewer.\n\nWhat to Say in Interviews to Show Mastery Over Dynamic Programming\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Articulate why dynamic programming is applicable (overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure) for a given problem\n*   Refer to the recurrence relation and base case(s). Reason about and justify that the subproblem dependencies are acyclic.\n*   Discuss and ask the interviewer if they have a preference when it comes to the tradeoffs between top-down (recursive) and bottom-up approaches.\n\nCommon Dynamic Programming Interview Questions\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHARD\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Alien Dictionary](https://interviewing.io/questions/alien-dictionary)\n\n[You are given a list of lexicographically sorted words from an alien language.

Again it’s all about practice.\n    \n\n![Diagramming a multi-dimenisional array used for tabulation.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dynamic_programming_tabulation_5ca70457ee.png?updated_at=2023-06-30T15:59:29.606Z)\n\n5.  Lack of clarity in communicating your dynamic programming logic. Visualizations can help a great deal here. As we’ve seen in this article, sketching a recursive tree or a matrix table can be helpful tools to gain shared understanding with your interviewer.\n\nWhat to Say in Interviews to Show Mastery Over Dynamic Programming\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Articulate why dynamic programming is applicable (overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure) for a given problem\n*   Refer to the recurrence relation and base case(s). Reason about and justify that the subproblem dependencies are acyclic.\n*   Discuss and ask the interviewer if they have a preference when it comes to the tradeoffs between top-down (recursive) and bottom-up approaches.\n\nCommon Dynamic Programming Interview Questions\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHARD\n\nData Structures and Algorithms",

Wahome | Published:\n\nWhat is a Linked List?\n----------------------\n\nA linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a reference to either the next node in the sequence, itself, or the node prior to it. They are designed to be efficient when performing insertions and deletions. The key to their efficiency as we will discuss further is the use of pointers to capture the order of the nodes.\n\nLinked lists come in different variations such as singly linked (nodes only point to the next node or the previous node in a reverse linked list), doubly linked, self-linked lists, and circular linked lists.\n\n### Types of Linked Lists\n\nSingly and doubly linked lists are the two major types based on the direction of linkage. That said, we will also expand on circular linked lists and self-linked lists. This is because they tend to be a major source of headaches when implementing Linked Lists thus understanding their properties will help avoid these pitfalls.\n\n*   1.  Singly-linked lists: each node has a link to the next node in the list, but not to the previous node.\n*   Doubly linked lists: each node has links to both the next node and the previous node in the list.\n*   Circular linked lists: the last node in the list points to the first node, creating a circular structure. This allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions.\n*   Self-referential linked lists or self-linked lists: each node contains a pointer or reference to itself. This type of linked list is not commonly used in practice but can be used in certain specialized scenarios such as implementing circular queues or resolving collisions by chaining in hashmaps.\n\n### Common Operations on Linked Lists\n\nTo effectively understand when to use a linked list, it helps to understand how we use them first.\n\n#### Linked List Traversal\n\nHere is some pseudocode for forward and backward traversals of a linked list:\n\n##### Forward Traversal\n\nBoth doubly and singly linked lists allow for a simple forward traversal. Do note the None check.\n\nPython\n\n    # class Node:\n    #    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    #        self.data = data\n    #        self.next = next\n    \n    current_node = head\n    while current_node is not None:\n        // Do something with the current node\n        current_node = current_node.next\n\n    1# class Node:\n    2#    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    3#        self.data = data\n    4#        self.next = next\n    5\n    6current_node = head\n    7while current_node is not None:\n    8    // Do something with the current node\n    9    current_node = current_node.next\n\n##### Backward Traversal\n\nDoubly linked lists will usually allow you to travel backward following the `prev` pointers.\n\nPython\n\n    current_node = tail\n    while current_node is not None:\n        // Do something with the current node\n        current_node = current_node.prev\n\n    1current_node = tail\n    2while current_node is not None:\n    3    // Do something with the current node\n    4    current_node = current_node.prev\n\n#### Insertion Into a Singly Linked List\n\nThe process for inserting an element into a singly linked list is as follows:\n\n1.  Create a new node containing the value to be inserted.\n2.  Determine the position where the new node will be inserted.\n3.  If the insertion position is at the front of the list, set the next in the new node to the current head of the list.\n4.  If the insertion position is somewhere in the middle of the list, find the node immediately preceding (prev) the position where the new node will be inserted. You can determine this by simply checking if the next node is in the position you want to insert. Your current node thus becomes your preceding node and the node following it becomes the previous next node.\n5.  Update the link in the preceding node to point to the new node.\n6.  Update the link in the new node to point to the node that was previously at the insertion position (The previous next node).\n7.  If the insertion position is at the end of the list, set the link in the preceding node to the new node, and set the link in the new node to None.\n\nInsertions into doubly-linked lists would entail also updating the previous pointer of the new node to the preceding node and the previous of the next node to the new node in addition to the updates required for inserting into a singly linked list.\n\n##### Head Insertion\n\nSimply set the new node’s next pointer to the current head. In case the list is empty, the new node becomes the head and tail, with its next pointing to None.\n\n##### Insertions into the Middle\n\nThese usually entail slicing the linked list and then setting pointers to the new node in preceding nodes and from the new node to the next nodes. The reverse also applies for doubly linked lists.\n\n![Step by step Insertion into a Linked List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image1_98aa45da19.jpg)\n\n##### Tail Insertion\n\nPoint the next pointer of the last node to the new node, and point the new node to None.\n\nThe time complexity for inserting an element in a singly linked list is **`O(n)`** in the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because finding the node immediately preceding the insertion position requires traversing the list, which can take up to **`O(n)` time**. The **space complexity** of inserting a new node into a singly linked list is **`O(1)`**, as only one new node is created and no additional memory is allocated.\n\n#### Deletion from a Singly Linked List\n\nThe process for deleting an element from a singly linked list is as follows:\n\n1.  Find the node to be deleted. If they exist, Keep track of the node pointing to it (preceding node) and the node immediately following the node we are deleting (next node).\n2.  If the node to be deleted is the head of the list, update the head to the next node of the head.\n3.  If the node to be deleted is in the middle of the list, point the preceding node link to the next node link, bypassing the node to be deleted.\n4.  Update the link in the preceding node to point to the node immediately following the node to be deleted.\n5.  If the node to be deleted is the tail of the list, update the link in the preceding node to point to None.\n\nThe time complexity for deleting an element from a singly linked list is also **`O(n)`** in the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because finding the node immediately preceding the deletion position requires traversing the list, which can take up to **`O(n)` time**. The **space complexity** is also `O(1)`.\n\n##### Head Deletion\n\nMake the new head the next node of the current head. This could be a node or None\n\n##### Deletions in the Middle\n\n![Step by step deletion from a Linked List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image1_98aa45da19.jpg)\n\n##### Tail Deletion\n\nMake the next of the second to last node point to None (Bypass the last non-None node)\n\n#### Insertion into Doubly Linked Lists\n\nInserting an element into a doubly linked list is similar to inserting an element into a singly linked list, only that the operations done to point next have to be repeated from the opposite direction. The following steps break down how we achieve this.\n\n1.  Create a new node containing the value to be inserted.\n2.  Determine the position where the new node will be inserted.\n3.  If the insertion position is at the front of the list, set the next in the new node to the current head of the list, and set the previous node’s next pointer to the new node.\n4.  If the insertion position is somewhere in the middle of the list, find the node immediately preceding the position where the new node will be inserted. You can determine this by simply checking if the next node is in the position you want to insert. Your **current node** thus becomes your **preceding node** and the node following it becomes the **previous next** node.\n5.  Update the **next** link in the preceding node to point to the **new node**.\n6.  Update the **previous** link in the **new node** to point to the **preceding node**.\n7.  Update the **previous** link in the **previous next** node to point to the **new node**.\n8.  Update the **next** link in the **new node** to point to the **previous next** node.\n\nSimilar to the singly linked list case, the time **complexity for insertions is `O(n)`** in the worst-case scenario. This is because finding the node immediately preceding the insertion position requires traversing the list, which can take up to `O(n)` time. The space complexity of inserting a new node into a doubly linked list is still `O(1)`.\n\n#### Deletion from a Doubly Linked List\n\nDeletion is a bit more straightforward.\n\n1.  Find the node to be deleted. Take note of the node preceding it and the node following it.\n2.  If the node to be deleted is the head of the list, update the head to the next node of the head, and set the previous link in the new head to None.\n3.  If the node to be deleted is in the middle of the list, update the **next** link in the **preceding node** to point to the **next node** (bypassing the node to be deleted).\n4.  Update the **previous** link in the **next node** to point to the **preceding node**.\n5.  If the node to be deleted is the tail of the list, update the previous link in the preceding node to point to None.\n\nThe time complexity and space complexity for this operation is also `O(n)` and `O(1)` respectively. This is again due to the traversal needed to locate the node we want to delete.\n\n#### Insertions and Deletions into Circular and Self-Linked Lists\n\nThese flavors will usually have linkage styles resembling either a singly or doubly linked list. In the case of circularly linked lists, the process resembles breaking, shortening, and reconnecting a chain. One note is that linear but self linked lists have the cycle occuring anywhere along the linked list. Circular linked lists will have the tail of the linked list point to the head. A special case is a single node, circular linked list which also can be considered a self linked list. The steps remain the same as above depending on the linking logic in the nodes affected.\n\n### Linked List implementation strategies\n\n#### Traditional Implementation (Using Nodes)\n\nThe classic way of implementing linked lists involves defining a Node class that contains a data attribute and a next attribute, which is a reference to the next node in the list. The data attribute contains the value stored in the node.\n\npython\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = next\n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    3        self.data = data\n    4        self.next = next\n\nTo create a linked list, we define a LinkedList class that contains a head attribute, which is a reference to the first node in the list. Initially, the head attribute is set to None to indicate an empty list.\n\nPython\n\n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = None\n\n    1class LinkedList:\n    2    def __init__(self):\n    3        self.head = None\n\nTo insert a new node at the beginning of the list, we create a new Node object containing the new value and set its next attribute to the current head of the list. We then set the head attribute of the list to the new node.\n\nPython\n\n     def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n            new_node = Node(data, self.head)\n            self.head = new_node\n\n    1 def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n    2        new_node = Node(data, self.head)\n    3        self.head = new_node\n\nTo insert a new node at the end of the list, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we simply set the head attribute to a new Node object containing the new value. Otherwise, we traverse the list until we reach the last node, and then set its next attribute to a new Node object containing the new value.\n\nPython\n\n     def insert_at_end(self, data):\n            if self.head is None:\n                self.head = Node(data, None)\n                return\n    \n            current_node = self.head\n            while current_node.next is not None:\n                current_node = current_node.next\n    \n            current_node.next = Node(data, None)\n\n    1 def insert_at_end(self, data):\n    2        if self.head is None:\n    3            self.head = Node(data, None)\n    4            return\n    5\n    6        current_node = self.head\n    7        while current_node.next is not None:\n    8            current_node = current_node.next\n    9\n    10        current_node.next = Node(data, None)\n\nTo delete a node from the list, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we simply return. Otherwise, we traverse the list until we find the node to be deleted, keeping track of the preceding node. We then update the next attribute of the preceding node to point to the node following the node to be deleted.\n\nPython\n\n     def delete_node(self, data):\n            if self.head is None:\n                return\n    \n            if self.head.data == data:\n                self.head = self.head.next\n                return\n    \n            current_node = self.head\n            while current_node.next is not None:\n                if current_node.next.data == data:\n                    current_node.next = current_node.next.next\n                    return\n                current_node = current_node.next\n\n    1 def delete_node(self, data):\n    2        if self.head is None:\n    3            return\n    4\n    5        if self.head.data == data:\n    6            self.head = self.head.next\n    7            return\n    8\n    9        current_node = self.head\n    10        while current_node.next is not None:\n    11            if current_node.next.data == data:\n    12                current_node.next = current_node.next.next\n    13                return\n    14            current_node = current_node.next\n\nA doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but each node also contains a reference to the previous node in addition to the next node.

Every element contains a value and a link to the next node in the list, represented by the index of the next element in the array. The last element in the array contains a special value, usually None, to indicate the end of the list. For example, consider the following array:\n\n    [(2, 1), (5, 2), (7, 3), (4, None)]\n    \n\nIn the above, the head is the first element, with the tuple representing the value as well as the next node’s index. The corresponding linked list would be as follows:\n\n    2 -> 5 -> 7 -> 4 -> None\n    \n\nLinked lists implemented with arrays have some advantages over traditionally implemented ones, such as better cache locality and the ability to preallocate memory. Array gives an additional benefit of constant time access to its element if the index is already known. This can speed up the retrieval of a node's value if its index in the array is already known. They come with some cons though, such as the need to allocate a fixed amount of memory, which can lead to wasted space or insufficient space for large lists, and the need to update links in the surrounding nodes as the pointers reference specific indices in the array. This shifting around means that the Insertion complexity is `O(n)`, in addition to the traversal cost. It doesn't really change the overall complexity in this regard, but it is less efficient.\n\n#### Hashmap Implementation\n\nGiven the implementation above using arrays, we can see how the hashmap implementation would work. Simply put, the representation for the above example would be as follows:\n\n     { \n       0: {'value': 2, 'next': 1}, \n       1: {'value': 5, 'next': 2}, \n       2: {'value': 7, 'next': 3}, \n       3: {'value': 4, 'next': None} \n     }\n    \n\nThe rest of the logic remains the same.\n\nDo note, in some cases, an array itself can be used to represent the pointers. This is a key insight to solve questions such as the [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)\n problem.\n\nThe values are not taken into account in the array representation, but noting them is as simple as using the tuple notation above or maintaining a separate list with the values ordered by the indices.\n\n#### Inbuilt Types\n\nIn some languages like Java and C++, LinkedLists are offered out of the box as part of the language. Here are examples in [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html)\n and [C++](https://cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/)\n.\n\nCompanies That Ask Linked List Questions\n----------------------------------------\n\n[![Amazon](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Famazon_128x128_15213fbc98.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Watch 31  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=amazon)\n\n[![Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fmicrosoft_com_128x128_e8c2de6d0b.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Watch 24  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=microsoft)\n\n[![Apple](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fapple_com_128x128_61116200e1.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Apple](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=apple)\n\n[![Robinhood](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Frobinhood_icon_1_87543b4560.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/robinhood-interview-questions)\n\n[Robinhood](https://interviewing.io/robinhood-interview-questions)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/robinhood-interview-questions)\n\n[![Snap](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsnap_com_128x128_370034302d.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/snap-interview-questions)\n\n[Snap](https://interviewing.io/snap-interview-questions)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/snap-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=snap)\n\n[![VMware](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fvmware_com_128x128_c0fa9c6c83.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/vmware-interview-questions)\n\n[VMware](https://interviewing.io/vmware-interview-questions)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/vmware-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=vmware)\n\nWhen to Use Linked Lists in Interviews\n--------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Implementing a [stack](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n     or [queue](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n     data structure**. Stacks and queues only add or remove from the ends, this can be achieved in a linked list the same way by adding or removing nodes from the head or tail of the list. A simple array-based implementation would suffice for this as we would be popping or appending to the array at the head or tail, but with constant time operations. Keep in mind, Appending an element at the beginning of the array (e.g. .shift() in JS) could be a costly O(n) operation as it requires shifting of all the array elements. As a result, array-based implementation for a queue could be costly. Linked List mitigates that cost.\n2.  **Maintaining a sorted list of values**. In this case, we can maintain a sorted list of values by inserting nodes in the correct position based on their value. With an array based implementation, searching for the position to insert nodes can be done in logarithmic time using binary search which improves the efficiency further. A Linked Hashmap implementation (See appendix) would be useful in this case.\n3.  **Implementing a [hash table](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n    **. We can implement a hash table by storing key-value pairs in nodes and using a hash function to determine the index of the linked list where the node should be stored with colliding nodes all pointing to the same index.\n4.  Implementing a [graph data structure](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n    . Fundamentally, linked lists are unary trees/ graphs.\n5.  **Implementing a [priority queue](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n    **. Linked lists are most commonly used to implement priority queues by maintaining the list in sorted order based on priority and inserting new nodes in the correct position. This is owing to the ease and efficiency of insertions and deletions.\n\nCommon Interview Mistakes Featuring Linked Lists\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Not knowing how to traverse the list**. a. It is key to know which direction, forward (to next node) or backward (to previous node) traversal. b. Check for **None** before trying to access the next or previous nodes. Interviewees often fail to account for the tail node being None. They thus try to perform node operations the same way they would with non-None nodes.\n2.  **Not using a dummy node when traversing or performing insertions and deletions**. See the dummy nodes section below to see how dummy nodes can simplify the code.\n3.  **Infinite loops with circular linked lists or self-linked lists**. These occur when nodes self-reference or we have a circular linked list. Caching seen nodes or using Floyd’s algorithm (Tortoise and Hare) can be useful for cycle detection. We go into detail on the algorithm in the mastery section.\n4.  **Overly complicated implementation**. Most people know to use nodes and pointers. However, most linked lists are usually simple enough to be implemented using an array or a hashmap.\n5.  **Complexity analysis fails to account for traversal**. The advantages of linked lists are many, including efficient insertions and deletions that have a reference to the location. However, finding the correct position for these operations, or searching for a specific node, can be costly as it requires traversing the list. When doing complexity analysis, it is key to account for this when doing the overall performance analysis. That said, the hashmap approach to implementation can help resolve the search inefficiency.\n6.  **Confusion with the insertion and deletion steps**. We go into extensive detail on this above.\n7.  **Failing to account for edge cases eg. insertions to the head or tail of the linked list**. Head and Tail insertions tend to be the most common insertion and deletion operations hence why it is important to remember how to deal with them.\n\nClarifying Questions to Ask Your Interviewer About Linked Lists\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **What operations do we need to perform?** If the core focus is the linked list implementation, otherwise infer from the case study and list these.\n2.  **Do we have a defined node structure?** If the class format is provided, implement a traditional linked list. If the case is simple enough, a hashmap or array may suffice.\n3.  **Is the linked list singly linked or doubly linked?** Clarify this. Don't be afraid to use a doubly linked list for the efficiency gains traversing forward and backward. If memory is not a constraint, see if you can use the Linked Hashmap implementation.\n4.  **Is there a limit to the size of the linked list?** This can be an issue especially if we are dealing with data streams. It may be easier and more efficient to use arrays or hashmaps with very large linked lists. Arrays are usually native (complex) data structures in most languages and thus are usually efficient to manipulate at scale.\n5.  **Do we want to account for the traversal complexity when doing the complexity analysis?** This is key as it shows mindfulness of an operation that overhauls a lot of the efficiency gains when using linked lists.\n\nHow to Show Mastery of Linked Lists in Interviews\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### Using a Dummy Node\n\nUsing a dummy node/ sentinel node in a linked list can simplify the code by eliminating the need to handle the edge case where the list is empty or the node to be deleted is the head of the list separately. This can make the code cleaner and easier to understand, and can also help to avoid bugs that may arise from handling edge cases inconsistently. However, using a dummy node does come with some overhead, as an extra node must be allocated and maintained. Whether or not to use a dummy node depends on the specific requirements of the application and the personal preference of the developer.\n\nIn the below example, we insert a node at the beginning of a linked list with a dummy node:\n\nPython\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = next\n    \n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = Node()\n    \n        def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n            new_node = Node(data, self.head.next)\n            self.head.next = new_node\n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    3        self.data = data\n    4        self.next = next\n    5\n    6class LinkedList:\n    7    def __init__(self):\n    8        self.head = Node()\n    9\n    10    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n    11        new_node = Node(data, self.head.next)\n    12        self.head.next = new_node\n\nAnd here's an example of inserting a node at the beginning of a linked list without a dummy node, where we have to handle the edge case where the list is empty separately:\n\nPython\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = next\n    \n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = None\n    \n        def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n            if self.head is None:\n                self.head = Node(data, None)\n            else:\n                new_node = Node(data, self.head)\n                self.head = new_node\n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    3        self.data = data\n    4        self.next = next\n    5\n    6class LinkedList:\n    7    def __init__(self):\n    8        self.head = None\n    9\n    10    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n    11        if self.head is None:\n    12            self.head = Node(data, None)\n    13        else:\n    14            new_node = Node(data, self.head)\n    15            self.head = new_node\n\nAs you can see, using a dummy node simplifies the code by eliminating the need to handle the edge case where the list is empty separately.\n\nSimilarly, to deleting a node from a linked list with a dummy node:\n\nPython\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = next\n    \n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = Node()\n    \n        def delete_node(self, data):\n            current_node = self.head\n            while current_node.next is not None:\n                if current_node.next.data == data:\n                    current_node.next = current_node.next.next\n                    return\n                current_node = current_node.next\n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    3        self.data = data\n    4        self.next = next\n    5\n    6class LinkedList:\n    7    def __init__(self):\n    8        self.head = Node()\n    9\n    10    def delete_node(self, data):\n    11        current_node = self.head\n    12        while current_node.next is not None:\n    13            if current_node.next.data == data:\n    14                current_node.next = current_node.next.next\n    15                return\n    16            current_node = current_node.next\n\nAnd here's a similar example without the dummy node::\n\nPython\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = next\n    \n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = None\n    \n        def delete_node(self, data):\n            if self.head is None:\n                return\n    \n            if self.head.data == data:\n                self.head = self.head.next\n                return\n    \n            current_node = self.head\n            while current_node.next is not None:\n                if current_node.next.data == data:\n                    current_node.next =

deleted is the head of the list separately.\n\n### Linked HashMap\n\nFurther reading [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/LinkedHashMap.html)\n.\n\nWe can take advantage of the O(1) lookup time hashmaps offer to efficiently implement LinkedLists. This can come in handy when tackling problems such as LRU cache where the order of insertion is not guaranteed to be sorted thus we need to constantly look back at the cache to update the frequency of occurrence of entries or update the next and previous pointers. Take note of the previous and next nodes alongside each current node. This is memory inefficient of course as it needs a separate structure but it only scales out the total space complexity linearly thus the space complexity overall does not change while guaranteeing `O(1)` insertions and deletions. This implementation would look as follows:\n\nPython\n\n    linked_map = {\n    \tcur_node: <prev_node, next_node>\n    \tprev_node: ...\n    \tnext-node: ...\n    }\n\n    1linked_map = {\n    2\tcur_node: <prev_node, next_node>\n    3\tprev_node: ...\n    4\tnext-node: ...\n    5}\n\n### Floyd’s Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)\n\nFloyd's algorithm is a heuristic algorithm that detects the presence of a cycle in a linked list and returns the starting node of the cycle. The algorithm works by using [two pointers](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n, one that moves at a slower pace (the tortoise) and one that moves at a faster pace (the hare), to traverse the linked list.\n\nThis algorithm takes advantage of the concept of overlapping. On a circular race track, should one vehicle/ racer be faster, they will eventually overlap the slower racers as they continuously put some distance between them and the competitors. Similarly, when traversing linked lists that have cycles, if we have two pointers with one being faster (typically twice the speed of the slower pointer), then they will eventually converge somewhere along the cycle.\n\nAssuming that the linked list has a cycle, the hare pointer will eventually catch up to the tortoise pointer and they will meet at a point in the cycle, which we will refer to as the meeting point. The distance traveled by the hare pointer will be twice the distance traveled by the tortoise pointer at the **meeting point**, since the hare moves twice as fast as the tortoise.\n\nNow let's consider the distance between the head of the linked list and the starting point of the cycle, which we will refer to as the loop start. Let this distance be denoted as \"x\", and let the length of the cycle be denoted as \"y\". We can express the distance traveled by the hare and tortoise pointers in terms of \"x\" and \"y\" as follows:\n\n*   Distance traveled by tortoise pointer = x + m \\* y (where m is an integer representing the number of complete cycles made by the pointer)\n*   Distance traveled by hare pointer = x + n \\* y (where n is an integer representing the number of complete cycles made by the pointer)\n\nSince the hare pointer moves twice as fast as the tortoise pointer, we can express the distance traveled by the hare pointer as twice the distance traveled by the tortoise pointer:\n\n    2 * (x + m * y) = x + n * y\n    \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n    x = (n - 2m) * y\n    \n\nThis equation tells us that the distance between the head of the linked list and the loop start is a multiple of the length of the cycle. If we reset the tortoise pointer to the head of the linked list and move both pointers at the same pace, the distance between the head of the linked list and the loop start will be equal to the distance between the meeting point and the loop start. Therefore, if we move the tortoise pointer and hare pointer at the same pace until they meet again, they will meet at the loop start. In conclusion, Floyd's algorithm will usually find the start of the linked list cycle because it takes advantage of the fact that the distance between the head of the linked list and the loop start is a multiple of the length of the cycle, and uses this fact to determine the location of the loop start.\n\npython\n\n    # define a Node class\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, val):\n            self.val = val\n            self.next = None\n    \n    # define a function to detect cycles in a linked list\n    def detect_cycle(head):\n        # initialize pointers\n        slow = head\n        fast = head\n    \n        # move pointers through linked list\n        while fast and fast.next:\n            slow = slow.next\n            fast = fast.next.next\n    \n            # check for cycle\n            if slow == fast:\n                # reset slow pointer\n                slow = head\n    \n                # move pointers until they meet again\n                while slow != fast:\n                    slow = slow.next\n                    fast = fast.next\n    \n                # return starting node of cycle\n                return slow\n    \n        # return None if no cycle is detected\n        return None\n    \n\n    1# define a Node class\n    2class Node:\n    3    def __init__(self, val):\n    4        self.val = val\n    5        self.next = None\n    6\n    7# define a function to detect cycles in a linked list\n    8def detect_cycle(head):\n    9    # initialize pointers\n    10    slow = head\n    11    fast = head\n    12\n    13    # move pointers through linked list\n    14    while fast and fast.next:\n    15        slow = slow.next\n    16        fast = fast.next.next\n    17\n    18        # check for cycle\n    19        if slow == fast:\n    20            # reset slow pointer\n    21            slow = head\n    22\n    23            # move pointers until they meet again\n    24            while slow != fast:\n    25                slow = slow.next\n    26                fast = fast.next\n    27\n    28            # return starting node of cycle\n    29            return slow\n    30\n    31    # return None if no cycle is detected\n    32    return None\n    33\n\nCommon Linked List interview Questions\n--------------------------------------\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Reverse a Linked List](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-linked-list)\n\n[Given the head of a linked list, reverse the list and return the new head.](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-linked-list)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Copy List With Random Pointers](https://interviewing.io/questions/copy-list-with-random-pointers)\n\n[Given a linked list with nodes that have an additional pointer referring to another node in the list, return a deep copy of the list.](https://interviewing.io/questions/copy-list-with-random-pointers)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Partition List](https://interviewing.io/questions/partition-list)\n\n[Given a list of integers L and a number K, write a function that reorganizes L into three partitions: elements less than K, elements equal to K, and elements greater than K.

This allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions.\n*   Self-referential linked lists or self-linked lists: each node contains a pointer or reference to itself. This type of linked list is not commonly used in practice but can be used in certain specialized scenarios such as implementing circular queues or resolving collisions by chaining in hashmaps.",

          "content": "### Common Operations on Linked Lists To effectively understand when to use a linked list, it helps to understand how we use them first. #### Linked List Traversal Here is some pseudocode for forward and backward traversals of a linked list: ##### Forward Traversal Both doubly and singly linked lists allow for a simple forward traversal. Do note the None check. Python # class Node: # def __init__(self, data=None, next=None): # self.data = data # self.next = next current_node = head while current_node is not None: // Do something with the current node current_node = current_node.next 1# class Node: 2# def __init__(self, data=None, next=None): 3# self.data = data 4# self.next = next 5 6current_node = head 7while current_node is not None: 8 // Do something with the current node 9 current_node = current_node.next ##### Backward Traversal Doubly linked lists will usually allow you to travel backward following the `prev` pointers. Python current_node = tail while current_node is not None: // Do something with the current node current_node = current_node.prev 1current_node = tail 2while current_node is not None: 3 // Do something with the current node 4 current_node = current_node.prev #### Insertion Into a Singly Linked List The process for inserting an element into a singly linked list is as follows: 1. Create a new node containing the value to be inserted. 2. Determine the position where the new node will be inserted. 3. If the insertion position is at the front of the list, set the next in the new node to the current head of the list. 4. If the insertion position is somewhere in the middle of the list, find the node immediately preceding (prev) the position where the new node will be inserted. You can determine this by simply checking if the next node is in the position you want to insert. Your current node thus becomes your preceding node and the node following it becomes the previous next node. 5. Update the link in the preceding node to point to the new node. 6. Update the link in the new node to point to the node that was previously at the insertion position (The previous next node). 7. If the insertion position is at the end of the list, set the link in the preceding node to the new node, and set the link in the new node to None. Insertions into doubly-linked lists would entail also updating the previous pointer of the new node to the preceding node and the previous of the next node to the new node in addition to the updates required for inserting into a singly linked list. ##### Head Insertion Simply set the new node’s next pointer to the current head. In case the list is empty, the new node becomes the head and tail, with its next pointing to None. ##### Insertions into the Middle These usually entail slicing the linked list and then setting pointers to the new node in preceding nodes and from the new node to the next nodes. The reverse also applies for doubly linked lists. ![Step by step Insertion into a Linked List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image1_98aa45da19.jpg) ##### Tail Insertion Point the next pointer of the last node to the new node, and point the new node to None. The time complexity for inserting an element in a singly linked list is **`O(n)`** in the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because finding the node immediately preceding the insertion position requires traversing the list, which can take up to **`O(n)` time**. The **space complexity** of inserting a new node into a singly linked list is **`O(1)`**, as only one new node is created and no additional memory is allocated. #### Deletion from a Singly Linked List The process for deleting an element from a singly linked list is as follows: 1. Find the node to be deleted. If they exist, Keep track of the node pointing to it (preceding node) and the node immediately following the node we are deleting (next node). 2. If the node to be deleted is the head of the list, update the head to the next node of the head. 3. If the node to be deleted is in the middle of the list, point the preceding node link to the next node link, bypassing the node to be deleted. 4. Update the link in the preceding node to point to the node immediately following the node to be deleted. 5. If the node to be deleted is the tail of the list, update the link in the preceding node to point to None. The time complexity for deleting an element from a singly linked list is also **`O(n)`** in the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because finding the node immediately preceding the deletion position requires traversing the list, which can take up to **`O(n)` time**. The **space complexity** is also `O(1)`. ##### Head Deletion Make the new head the next node of the current head. This could be a node or None ##### Deletions in the Middle ![Step by step deletion from a Linked List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image1_98aa45da19.jpg) ##### Tail Deletion Make the next of the second to last node point to None (Bypass the last non-None node) #### Insertion into Doubly Linked Lists Inserting an element into a doubly linked list is similar to inserting an element into a singly linked list, only that the operations done to point next have to be repeated from the opposite direction. The following steps break down how we achieve this. 1. Create a new node containing the value to be inserted. 2. Determine the position where the new node will be inserted. 3. If the insertion position is at the front of the list, set the next in the new node to the current head of the list, and set the previous node’s next pointer to the new node. 4.",

If the insertion position is at the front of the list, set the next in the new node to the current head of the list, and set the previous node’s next pointer to the new node. 4. If the insertion position is somewhere in the middle of the list, find the node immediately preceding the position where the new node will be inserted. You can determine this by simply checking if the next node is in the position you want to insert. Your **current node** thus becomes your **preceding node** and the node following it becomes the **previous next** node. 5. Update the **next** link in the preceding node to point to the **new node**. 6. Update the **previous** link in the **new node** to point to the **preceding node**. 7. Update the **previous** link in the **previous next** node to point to the **new node**. 8. Update the **next** link in the **new node** to point to the **previous next** node. Similar to the singly linked list case, the time **complexity for insertions is `O(n)`** in the worst-case scenario. This is because finding the node immediately preceding the insertion position requires traversing the list, which can take up to `O(n)` time. The space complexity of inserting a new node into a doubly linked list is still `O(1)`. #### Deletion from a Doubly Linked List Deletion is a bit more straightforward. 1. Find the node to be deleted. Take note of the node preceding it and the node following it. 2. If the node to be deleted is the head of the list, update the head to the next node of the head, and set the previous link in the new head to None. 3. If the node to be deleted is in the middle of the list, update the **next** link in the **preceding node** to point to the **next node** (bypassing the node to be deleted). 4. Update the **previous** link in the **next node** to point to the **preceding node**. 5. If the node to be deleted is the tail of the list, update the previous link in the preceding node to point to None. The time complexity and space complexity for this operation is also `O(n)` and `O(1)` respectively. This is again due to the traversal needed to locate the node we want to delete. #### Insertions and Deletions into Circular and Self-Linked Lists These flavors will usually have linkage styles resembling either a singly or doubly linked list. In the case of circularly linked lists, the process resembles breaking, shortening, and reconnecting a chain. One note is that linear but self linked lists have the cycle occuring anywhere along the linked list. Circular linked lists will have the tail of the linked list point to the head. A special case is a single node, circular linked list which also can be considered a self linked list. The steps remain the same as above depending on the linking logic in the nodes affected.",

          "content": "### Linked List implementation strategies #### Traditional Implementation (Using Nodes) The classic way of implementing linked lists involves defining a Node class that contains a data attribute and a next attribute, which is a reference to the next node in the list. The data attribute contains the value stored in the node. python class Node: def __init__(self, data=None, next=None): self.data = data self.next = next 1class Node: 2 def __init__(self, data=None, next=None): 3 self.data = data 4 self.next = next To create a linked list, we define a LinkedList class that contains a head attribute, which is a reference to the first node in the list. Initially, the head attribute is set to None to indicate an empty list. Python class LinkedList: def __init__(self): self.head = None 1class LinkedList: 2 def __init__(self): 3 self.head = None To insert a new node at the beginning of the list, we create a new Node object containing the new value and set its next attribute to the current head of the list. We then set the head attribute of the list to the new node. Python def insert_at_beginning(self, data): new_node = Node(data, self.head) self.head = new_node 1 def insert_at_beginning(self, data): 2 new_node = Node(data, self.head) 3 self.head = new_node To insert a new node at the end of the list, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we simply set the head attribute to a new Node object containing the new value. Otherwise, we traverse the list until we reach the last node, and then set its next attribute to a new Node object containing the new value. Python def insert_at_end(self, data): if self.head is None: self.head = Node(data, None) return current_node = self.head while current_node.next is not None: current_node = current_node.next current_node.next = Node(data, None) 1 def insert_at_end(self, data): 2 if self.head is None: 3 self.head = Node(data, None) 4 return 5 6 current_node = self.head 7 while current_node.next is not None: 8 current_node = current_node.next 9 10 current_node.next = Node(data, None) To delete a node from the list, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we simply return. Otherwise, we traverse the list until we find the node to be deleted, keeping track of the preceding node. We then update the next attribute of the preceding node to point to the node following the node to be deleted. Python def delete_node(self, data): if self.head is None: return if self.head.data == data: self.head = self.head.next return current_node = self.head while current_node.next is not None: if current_node.next.data == data: current_node.next = current_node.next.next return current_node = current_node.next 1 def delete_node(self, data): 2 if self.head is None: 3 return 4 5 if self.head.data == data: 6 self.head = self.head.next 7 return 8 9 current_node = self.head 10 while current_node.next is not None: 11 if current_node.next.data == data: 12 current_node.next = current_node.next.next 13 return 14 current_node = current_node.next A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but each node also contains a reference to the previous node in addition to the next node. This allows for more efficient traversal of the list in both directions. Python class Node: def __init__(self, data=None, prev=None, next=None): self.data = data self.prev = prev self.next = next class DoublyLinkedList: def __init__(self): self.head = None def insert_at_beginning(self, data): if self.head is None: new_node = Node(data, None, None) self.head = new_node else: new_node = Node(data, None, self.head) self.head.prev = new_node self.head = new_node def insert_at_end(self, data): if self.head is None: new_node = Node(data, None, None) self.head = new_node else: current_node = self.head while current_node.next is not None: current_node = current_node.next new_node = Node(data, current_node, None) current_node.next = new_node def delete_node(self, data): if self.head is None: return current_node = self.head while current_node is not None: if current_node.data == data: if current_node.prev is not None: current_node.prev.next = current_node.next else: self.head = current_node.next if current_node.next is not None: current_node.next.prev = current_node.prev return current_node = current_node.next 1class Node: 2 def __init__(self, data=None, prev=None, next=None): 3 self.data = data 4 self.prev = prev 5 self.next = next 6 7class DoublyLinkedList: 8 def __init__(self): 9 self.head = None 10 11 def insert_at_beginning(self, data): 12 if self.head is None: 13 new_node = Node(data, None, None) 14 self.head = new_node 15 else: 16 new_node = Node(data, None, self.head) 17 self.head.prev = new_node 18 self.head = new_node 19 20 def insert_at_end(self, data): 21 if self.head is None: 22 new_node = Node(data, None, None) 23 self.head = new_node 24 else: 25 current_node = self.head 26 while current_node.next is not None: 27 current_node = current_node.next 28 new_node = Node(data, current_node, None) 29 current_node.next = new_node 30 31 def delete_node(self, data): 32 if self.head is None: 33 return 34 35 current_node = self.head 36 while current_node is not None: 37 if current_node.data == data: 38 if current_node.prev is not None: 39 current_node.prev.next = current_node.next 40 else: 41 self.head = current_node.next 42 if current_node.next is not None: 43 current_node.next.prev = current_node.prev 44 return 45 current_node = current_node.next #### Array Implementation Linked lists can be implemented using [arrays](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions) , where each element of the array represents a node in the linked list. Every element contains a value and a link to the next node in the list, represented by the index of the next element in the array. The last element in the array contains a special value, usually None, to indicate the end of the list. For example, consider the following array: [(2, 1), (5, 2), (7, 3), (4, None)] In the above, the head is the first element, with the tuple representing the value as well as the next node’s index. The corresponding linked list would be as follows: 2 -> 5 -> 7 -> 4 -> None Linked lists implemented with arrays have some advantages over traditionally implemented ones, such as better cache locality and the ability to preallocate memory. Array gives an additional benefit of constant time access to its element if the index is already known.",

          "content": "2 -> 5 -> 7 -> 4 -> None Linked lists implemented with arrays have some advantages over traditionally implemented ones, such as better cache locality and the ability to preallocate memory. Array gives an additional benefit of constant time access to its element if the index is already known. This can speed up the retrieval of a node's value if its index in the array is already known. They come with some cons though, such as the need to allocate a fixed amount of memory, which can lead to wasted space or insufficient space for large lists, and the need to update links in the surrounding nodes as the pointers reference specific indices in the array. This shifting around means that the Insertion complexity is `O(n)`, in addition to the traversal cost. It doesn't really change the overall complexity in this regard, but it is less efficient. #### Hashmap Implementation Given the implementation above using arrays, we can see how the hashmap implementation would work. Simply put, the representation for the above example would be as follows: { 0: {'value': 2, 'next': 1}, 1: {'value': 5, 'next': 2}, 2: {'value': 7, 'next': 3}, 3: {'value': 4, 'next': None} } The rest of the logic remains the same. Do note, in some cases, an array itself can be used to represent the pointers. This is a key insight to solve questions such as the [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/) problem. The values are not taken into account in the array representation, but noting them is as simple as using the tuple notation above or maintaining a separate list with the values ordered by the indices. #### Inbuilt Types In some languages like Java and C++, LinkedLists are offered out of the box as part of the language. Here are examples in [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) and [C++](https://cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/) .

Stacks and queues only add or remove from the ends, this can be achieved in a linked list the same way by adding or removing nodes from the head or tail of the list. A simple array-based implementation would suffice for this as we would be popping or appending to the array at the head or tail, but with constant time operations. Keep in mind, Appending an element at the beginning of the array (e.g. .shift() in JS) could be a costly O(n) operation as it requires shifting of all the array elements. As a result, array-based implementation for a queue could be costly. Linked List mitigates that cost. 2. **Maintaining a sorted list of values**. In this case, we can maintain a sorted list of values by inserting nodes in the correct position based on their value. With an array based implementation, searching for the position to insert nodes can be done in logarithmic time using binary search which improves the efficiency further. A Linked Hashmap implementation (See appendix) would be useful in this case. 3. **Implementing a [hash table](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions) **. We can implement a hash table by storing key-value pairs in nodes and using a hash function to determine the index of the linked list where the node should be stored with colliding nodes all pointing to the same index. 4. Implementing a [graph data structure](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions) . Fundamentally, linked lists are unary trees/ graphs. 5. **Implementing a [priority queue](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions) **. Linked lists are most commonly used to implement priority queues by maintaining the list in sorted order based on priority and inserting new nodes in the correct position. This is owing to the ease and efficiency of insertions and deletions. Common Interview Mistakes Featuring Linked Lists ------------------------------------------------ 1. **Not knowing how to traverse the list**. a. It is key to know which direction, forward (to next node) or backward (to previous node) traversal. b. Check for **None** before trying to access the next or previous nodes. Interviewees often fail to account for the tail node being None. They thus try to perform node operations the same way they would with non-None nodes. 2. **Not using a dummy node when traversing or performing insertions and deletions**. See the dummy nodes section below to see how dummy nodes can simplify the code. 3. **Infinite loops with circular linked lists or self-linked lists**. These occur when nodes self-reference or we have a circular linked list. Caching seen nodes or using Floyd’s algorithm (Tortoise and Hare) can be useful for cycle detection. We go into detail on the algorithm in the mastery section. 4. **Overly complicated implementation**. Most people know to use nodes and pointers. However, most linked lists are usually simple enough to be implemented using an array or a hashmap. 5. **Complexity analysis fails to account for traversal**. The advantages of linked lists are many, including efficient insertions and deletions that have a reference to the location. However, finding the correct position for these operations, or searching for a specific node, can be costly as it requires traversing the list. When doing complexity analysis, it is key to account for this when doing the overall performance analysis. That said, the hashmap approach to implementation can help resolve the search inefficiency. 6. **Confusion with the insertion and deletion steps**. We go into extensive detail on this above. 7. **Failing to account for edge cases eg. insertions to the head or tail of the linked list**. Head and Tail insertions tend to be the most common insertion and deletion operations hence why it is important to remember how to deal with them.",

If the case is simple enough, a hashmap or array may suffice. 3. **Is the linked list singly linked or doubly linked?** Clarify this. Don't be afraid to use a doubly linked list for the efficiency gains traversing forward and backward. If memory is not a constraint, see if you can use the Linked Hashmap implementation. 4. **Is there a limit to the size of the linked list?** This can be an issue especially if we are dealing with data streams. It may be easier and more efficient to use arrays or hashmaps with very large linked lists. Arrays are usually native (complex) data structures in most languages and thus are usually efficient to manipulate at scale. 5. **Do we want to account for the traversal complexity when doing the complexity analysis?** This is key as it shows mindfulness of an operation that overhauls a lot of the efficiency gains when using linked lists.

          "content": "### Using a Dummy Node\n\nUsing a dummy node/ sentinel node in a linked list can simplify the code by eliminating the need to handle the edge case where the list is empty or the node to be deleted is the head of the list separately. This can make the code cleaner and easier to understand, and can also help to avoid bugs that may arise from handling edge cases inconsistently. However, using a dummy node does come with some overhead, as an extra node must be allocated and maintained. Whether or not to use a dummy node depends on the specific requirements of the application and the personal preference of the developer.\n\nIn the below example, we insert a node at the beginning of a linked list with a dummy node:\n\nPython\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = next\n    \n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = Node()\n    \n        def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n            new_node = Node(data, self.head.next)\n            self.head.next = new_node\n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    3        self.data = data\n    4        self.next = next\n    5\n    6class LinkedList:\n    7    def __init__(self):\n    8        self.head = Node()\n    9\n    10    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n    11        new_node = Node(data, self.head.next)\n    12        self.head.next = new_node\n\nAnd here's an example of inserting a node at the beginning of a linked list without a dummy node, where we have to handle the edge case where the list is empty separately:\n\nPython\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = next\n    \n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = None\n    \n        def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n            if self.head is None:\n                self.head = Node(data, None)\n            else:\n                new_node = Node(data, self.head)\n                self.head = new_node\n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    3        self.data = data\n    4        self.next = next\n    5\n    6class LinkedList:\n    7    def __init__(self):\n    8        self.head = None\n    9\n    10    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):\n    11        if self.head is None:\n    12            self.head = Node(data, None)\n    13        else:\n    14            new_node = Node(data, self.head)\n    15            self.head = new_node\n\nAs you can see, using a dummy node simplifies the code by eliminating the need to handle the edge case where the list is empty separately.\n\nSimilarly, to deleting a node from a linked list with a dummy node:\n\nPython\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = next\n    \n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = Node()\n    \n        def delete_node(self, data):\n            current_node = self.head\n            while current_node.next is not None:\n                if current_node.next.data == data:\n                    current_node.next = current_node.next.next\n                    return\n                current_node = current_node.next\n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    3        self.data = data\n    4        self.next = next\n    5\n    6class LinkedList:\n    7    def __init__(self):\n    8        self.head = Node()\n    9\n    10    def delete_node(self, data):\n    11        current_node = self.head\n    12        while current_node.next is not None:\n    13            if current_node.next.data == data:\n    14                current_node.next = current_node.next.next\n    15                return\n    16            current_node = current_node.next\n\nAnd here's a similar example without the dummy node::\n\nPython\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next = next\n    \n    class LinkedList:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.head = None\n    \n        def delete_node(self, data):\n            if self.head is None:\n                return\n    \n            if self.head.data == data:\n                self.head = self.head.next\n                return\n    \n            current_node = self.head\n            while current_node.next is not None:\n                if current_node.next.data == data:\n                    current_node.next = current_node.next.next\n                    return\n                current_node = current_node.next\n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):\n    3        self.data = data\n    4        self.next = next\n    5\n    6class LinkedList:\n    7    def __init__(self):\n    8        self.head = None\n    9\n    10    def delete_node(self, data):\n    11        if

 22                return\n    23            current_node = current_node.next\n\nAgain, using a dummy node simplifies the code by eliminating the need to handle the edge case where the node to be deleted is the head of the list separately.",

This can come in handy when tackling problems such as LRU cache where the order of insertion is not guaranteed to be sorted thus we need to constantly look back at the cache to update the frequency of occurrence of entries or update the next and previous pointers. Take note of the previous and next nodes alongside each current node. This is memory inefficient of course as it needs a separate structure but it only scales out the total space complexity linearly thus the space complexity overall does not change while guaranteeing `O(1)` insertions and deletions. This implementation would look as follows:\n\nPython\n\n    linked_map = {\n    \tcur_node: <prev_node, next_node>\n    \tprev_node: ...\n    \tnext-node: ...\n    }\n\n    1linked_map = {\n    2\tcur_node: <prev_node, next_node>\n    3\tprev_node: ...\n    4\tnext-node: ...\n    5}",

          "content": "### Floyd’s Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)\n\nFloyd's algorithm is a heuristic algorithm that detects the presence of a cycle in a linked list and returns the starting node of the cycle. The algorithm works by using [two pointers](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n, one that moves at a slower pace (the tortoise) and one that moves at a faster pace (the hare), to traverse the linked list.\n\nThis algorithm takes advantage of the concept of overlapping. On a circular race track, should one vehicle/ racer be faster, they will eventually overlap the slower racers as they continuously put some distance between them and the competitors. Similarly, when traversing linked lists that have cycles, if we have two pointers with one being faster (typically twice the speed of the slower pointer), then they will eventually converge somewhere along the cycle.\n\nAssuming that the linked list has a cycle, the hare pointer will eventually catch up to the tortoise pointer and they will meet at a point in the cycle, which we will refer to as the meeting point. The distance traveled by the hare pointer will be twice the distance traveled by the tortoise pointer at the **meeting point**, since the hare moves twice as fast as the tortoise.\n\nNow let's consider the distance between the head of the linked list and the starting point of the cycle, which we will refer to as the loop start. Let this distance be denoted as \"x\", and let the length of the cycle be denoted as \"y\". We can express the distance traveled by the hare and tortoise pointers in terms of \"x\" and \"y\" as follows:\n\n*   Distance traveled by tortoise pointer = x + m \\* y (where m is an integer representing the number of complete cycles made by the pointer)\n*   Distance traveled by hare pointer = x + n \\* y (where n is an integer representing the number of complete cycles made by the pointer)\n\nSince the hare pointer moves twice as fast as the tortoise pointer, we can express the distance traveled by the hare pointer as twice the distance traveled by the tortoise pointer:\n\n    2 * (x + m * y) = x + n * y\n    \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n    x = (n - 2m) * y\n    \n\nThis equation tells us that the distance between the head of the linked list and the loop start is a multiple of the length of the cycle. If we reset the tortoise pointer to the head of the linked list and move both pointers at the same pace, the distance between the head of the linked list and the loop start will be equal to the distance between the meeting point and the loop start. Therefore, if we move the tortoise pointer and hare pointer at the same pace until they meet again, they will meet at the loop start. In conclusion, Floyd's algorithm will usually find the start of the linked list cycle because it takes advantage of the fact that the distance between the head of the linked list and the loop start is a multiple of the length of the cycle, and uses this fact to determine the location of the loop start.\n\npython\n\n    # define a Node class\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, val):\n            self.val = val\n            self.next = None\n    \n    # define a function to detect cycles in a linked list\n    def detect_cycle(head):\n        # initialize pointers\n        slow = head\n        fast = head\n    \n        # move pointers through linked list\n        while fast and fast.next:\n            slow = slow.next\n            fast = fast.next.next\n    \n            # check for cycle\n            if slow == fast:\n                # reset slow pointer\n                slow = head\n    \n                # move pointers until they meet again\n                while slow != fast:\n                    slow = slow.next\n                    fast = fast.next\n    \n                # return starting node of cycle\n                return slow\n    \n        # return None if no cycle is detected\n        return None\n    \n\n    1# define a Node class\n    2class Node:\n    3    def __init__(self, val):\n    4        self.val = val\n    5        self.next = None\n    6\n    7# define a function to detect cycles in a linked list\n    8def detect_cycle(head):\n    9    # initialize pointers\n    10    slow = head\n    11    fast = head\n    12\n    13    # move pointers through linked list\n    14    while fast and fast.next:\n    15        slow = slow.next\n    16        fast = fast.next.next\n    17\n    18        # check for cycle\n    19        if slow == fast:\n    20            # reset slow pointer\n    21            slow = head\n    22\n    23            # move pointers until they meet again\n    24            while slow != fast:\n    25                slow = slow.next\n    26                fast = fast.next\n    27\n    28            # return starting node of cycle\n    29            return slow\n    30\n    31    # return None if no cycle is detected\n    32    return None\n    33\n\nCommon Linked List interview Questions\n--------------------------------------\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms",

This article explores their various forms and patterns, helping candidates navigate common pitfalls and effectively demonstrate mastery of this essential data structure.\n\nWhat are Arrays?\n----------------\n\nArrays are a fundamental data structure comprising a collection of elements. They represent a contiguous block of memory and are often used to store collections of data of the same type. If we know the address of an array in memory, we can calculate the address of each element by adding an offset to the base address. Arrays are very efficient with respect to memory usage and provide fast access to individual elements. They are so useful that most programming languages natively incorporate them.\n\nArrays are usually fixed in size and have a specific number of elements. Some languages like Ruby and JavaScript offer dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size. However, these dynamic arrays are still implemented under the hood as fixed-size arrays. When they reach capacity, new arrays are created with double the capacity, and the old array is copied over. This is an expensive operation. Therefore we use an array when we know the collection size in advance.\n\n### Types of Arrays\n\nArrays come in different shapes and sizes. Let's use an analogy to understand the different types of arrays.\n\nThe simplest and most common type is the one-dimensional array, similar to a row of houses on the street. This type of array consists of elements stored in a contiguous block of memory, much like houses lined up side by side. Each house, like an array element, has its unique address or index. The 'length' of this street or array is simply the count of houses or elements it hosts.\n\n![An array is like a row of houses. The house number represents the address of each row item. Each house represents the item itself.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/arrays_1_71c15c886f.png)\n\nElevating complexity, a two-dimensional array mirrors a city grid. Streets and avenues form a grid, each housing numerous homes. Each home's location can be identified using its street and house number, similar to a two-dimensional array's pair of indices. The total count of houses across the city grid corresponds to the total elements in the array.\n\n![Alt - A two-dimensional array is like a city grid. A street and house number identify each house.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/arrays_2_073571964f.png)\n\nFor a three-dimensional array, picture a towering skyscraper in the city grid. Each floor is its own grid of streets and houses. Every apartment (element) is located using a floor number, street number, and house number, much like multiple indices in a multidimensional array. The total number of apartments across all the floors reflects the total elements within the array. While you can have an array with an arbitrary number of dimensions, in coding interviews it is rare to see more than three dimensions used.\n\n### Array Operations\n\nArrays are best used when accessing an element by its index. This is a constant time `O(1)` operation. This is the primary benefit of arrays over other data structures like [linked lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n, where finding a specific element necessitates traversing the list, resulting in a linear time `O(n)` operation. However, the insertion or deletion of elements might not be as efficient, given that all the elements to the right or left of the insertion or deletion point must be shifted. This is also a linear time `O(n)` operation. Similarly, if you’re searching for an element in an unsorted array, you’ll have to examine the entire array, which is also a linear time `O(n)` operation. However, the story changes if the array is sorted. We'll delve into this facet later in the article.\n\nCompanies That Ask Array Questions\n----------------------------------\n\n[![Google](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgoogle_com_128x128_2818837343.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Google](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Watch 40  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=google)\n\n[![Meta](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fmeta_com_128x128_b410083a0c.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook)\n\n[Meta](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook)\n\n[Watch 27  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=meta)\n\n[![Amazon](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Famazon_128x128_15213fbc98.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Watch 31  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=amazon)\n\n[![Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fmicrosoft_com_128x128_e8c2de6d0b.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Watch 24  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=microsoft)\n\n[![Netflix](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fnetflix_com_128x128_6507a7127a.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix)\n\n[Netflix](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix)\n\n[Watch 2  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=netflix)\n\n[![Apple](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fapple_com_128x128_61116200e1.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Apple](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=apple)\n\nWhen to Use Arrays in Interviews\n--------------------------------\n\nAn array, at its core, is a very simple data structure. However, its versatility lies in its simplicity. It's akin to human cells: simple in isolation, yet they form complex organisms when combined.\n\nArrays form the backbone of many interview questions, whether they revolve around [sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n, [searching](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n, [dynamic programming](https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n, or other algorithmic concepts. They are often employed in scenarios where storing and accessing elements in a sequential or ordered manner is required. This includes [strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n, which are fundamentally just arrays of characters under the hood. Arrays also prove helpful when there's a need for constant-time access to elements based on their index.\n\nHere are some instances when you can use arrays in interviews.\n\n### Iterating Over a Collection of Elements in a Specific Order\n\nArrays are the go-to data structure when you need to iterate over a collection of elements in a specific order. Since elements in an array are laid out contiguously and have a unique index, iterating over them in any given order (forward, backward, or even at irregular intervals) is quite straightforward.\n\nSuppose you are given a coding challenge during an interview where you are asked to square every array element in place. Such operations can be performed efficiently thanks to arrays, as we can access and modify each element via its index.\n\nHere's how you might implement this in Python:\n\nPython\n\n    def square_array(arr):\n        for i in range(len(arr)):\n            arr[i] = arr[i] * arr[i]\n        return arr\n\n    1def square_array(arr):\n    2    for i in range(len(arr)):\n    3        arr[i] = arr[i] * arr[i]\n    4    return arr\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that when the order of elements doesn't matter, other data structures such as sets or maps can be more appropriate, offering unique benefits like constant-time lookups and insertions, depending on the specific scenario.\n\n### Sorting a Collection of Elements\n\nSorting is a typical operation performed on arrays. In interview scenarios, understanding various sorting algorithms and their efficiencies is critical. An array can be an intuitive choice when we need to sort elements, whether integers or objects, in a specific order.\n\nConsider an example where you have an array of integers; the task is to sort this array in ascending order. Most languages provide a built-in function that can be used to sort arrays. In Python, we have both the `sort()` and `sorted()` functions available for this purpose. The `sort()` method sorts the array in-place, meaning it modifies the original array:\n\nPython\n\n    def sort_elements(arr):\n        arr.sort()\n        return arr\n\n    1def sort_elements(arr):\n    2    arr.sort()\n    3    return arr\n\nOn the other hand, the `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence, leaving the original sequence unaffected. It's beneficial when you want to keep the original array intact and need a sorted version of it.\n\nRead more about sorting algorithms in our [Sorting guide](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n.\n\n### Searching for an Element in a Sorted Collection\n\nWhen you are given a sorted collection, binary search may be an effective solution. Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used for searching in a sorted array. It halves the search space at every step, making it highly efficient with `O(log n)` time complexity. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful or the remaining half is empty.\n\nArrays are particularly useful when performing a binary search, as they provide constant-time access to the item in the middle of the array. Compare this to a linked list, where you'd have to traverse the list to find the middle element, which would take linear time.\n\nPython\n\n    def binary_search(arr, x):\n        low = 0\n        high = len(arr) - 1\n        mid = 0\n    \n        while low <= high:\n    \n            mid = (high + low) // 2\n    \n            # If x is greater, ignore left half\n            if arr[mid] < x:\n                low = mid + 1\n    \n            # If x is smaller, ignore right half\n            elif arr[mid] > x:\n                high = mid - 1\n    \n            # x is present at mid\n            else:\n                return mid\n    \n        # If we reach here, then the element was not present\n        return -1\n\n    1def binary_search(arr, x):\n    2    low = 0\n    3    high = len(arr) - 1\n    4    mid = 0\n    5\n    6    while low <= high:\n    7\n    8        mid = (high + low) // 2\n    9\n    10        # If x is greater, ignore left half\n    11        if arr[mid] < x:\n    12            low = mid + 1\n    13\n    14        # If x is smaller, ignore right half\n    15        elif arr[mid] > x:\n    16            high = mid - 1\n    17\n    18        # x is present at mid\n    19        else:\n    20            return mid\n    21\n    22    # If we reach here, then the element was not present\n    23    return -1\n\nBinary search seems straightforward in concept, but questions on this topic come in various forms and complexities. Some problems ask you to find the first or last occurrence of a number, and others require you to find the smallest or largest number that meets a specific condition. Thus, it is essential to practice a diverse set of problems on binary search to recognize its patterns and application in different scenarios.\n\n### Two Pointers\n\n\"[Two Pointers](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\" is a common technique for solving array problems, especially when dealing with sequential access or when there's a need to keep track of two places in the array simultaneously. The two pointers might move in the same direction, opposite directions, or one might remain stationary while the other moves; the specific pattern depends on the problem.\n\nA classic example is reversing an array in-place. We position pointers at the start and end of the array and swap the corresponding elements. These pointers then converge towards the center, effectively reversing the array in-place.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\npython\n\n    def reverse_array(arr):\n        start = 0\n        end = len(arr) - 1\n    \n        while start < end:\n            arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n            start += 1\n            end -= 1\n    \n        return arr\n\n    1def reverse_array(arr):\n    2    start = 0\n    3    end = len(arr) - 1\n    4\n    5    while start < end:\n    6        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n    7        start += 1\n    8        end -= 1\n    9\n    10    return arr\n\nIt is worth nothing that this approach is applicable to strings as well. However, as strings are treated as immutable in many languages, including Python, we can't perform in-place operations on them directly. In such scenarios, we can convert the string to a list (which is mutable), perform the in-place reversal, and then convert it back to a string.\n\nThe utility of this technique is quite broad,for instance, in detecting palindromes or solving the two-sum problem. Mastery of this approach not only aids in array-related queries but also extends to solving linked list related problems, such as identifying the middle element or detecting a cycle within the list.\n\n### Sliding Window Problems\n\n[Sliding window problems](https://interviewing.io/sliding-window-interview-questions)\n often require tracking a subset of an array. In these problems, you deal with a 'window' of elements, adjusting its size or shifting its position based on the problem's requirements, all while maintaining the desired property in this window.\n\nFor example, if asked to find the [maximum sum of any size k subarray](https://interviewing.io/questions/subarray-sum-equals-k)\n, we could use a sliding window approach. Here's a simplified Python solution:\n\nPython\n\n    def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):\n        # Compute sum of the first window of size k\n        # arr[:k] slices the array from index 0 to k\n        window_sum = sum(arr[:k])\n        max_sum = window_sum\n    \n        for i in range(k, len(arr)):\n            # Compute sum of next window of size k by\n            # removing the first element of the previous\n            # window and adding the next element\n            window_sum = window_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)\n        \n        return max_sum\n\n    1def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):\n    2    # Compute sum of the first window of size k\n    3    # arr[:k] slices the array from index 0 to k\n    4    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])\n    5    max_sum = window_sum\n    6\n    7    for i in range(k, len(arr)):\n    8        # Compute sum of next window of size k by\n    9        # removing the first element of the previous\n    10        # window and adding the next element\n    11        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]\n    12        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)\n    13    \n    14    return max_sum\n\n### Implementing Other Data Structures\n\nArrays are often the foundational building blocks for more complex data structures. Their simplicity and efficient characteristics make them ideal for this role. For instance, [stacks](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n and [queues](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n, data structures that manage elements in a specific order, often use arrays to organize their elements. Arrays offer the advantage of efficient access, making them a popular choice for these structures.\n\nAlso, arrays are critical in depicting complex structures such as heaps and graphs. Graphs can be implemented using arrays through an adjacency matrix or list. Particularly with an adjacency list, arrays store adjacent vertices, offering a space-efficient method for representing sparse graphs. We'll learn more about implementing graphs using arrays later in this article.\n\nCommon Mistakes in Interviews Featuring Arrays\n----------------------------------------------\n\nArray-related questions can be trickier than they appear due to their simple structure, often causing interviewees to stumble. Arrays are a fundamental topic that also serves as a stepping stone to more advanced concepts. Consequently, understanding them thoroughly and being aware of common mistakes is vital. This section will highlight these common pitfalls and offer strategies to avoid them effectively.\n\n### Off-by-One Errors and Array Out of Bounds\n\nOff-by-one errors, also known as OBOEs, are among the most common errors. These typically happen when indexing arrays, especially in languages that use zero-based indexing, like Python and Java (There are a number of languages that use one-based indexing as well, such as Lua, R, Julia, COBOL, etc.) For example, suppose you are given an array; and you need to access the last element. It’s common to see mistakes like this:\n\npython\n\n    def access_last_element(nums):\n        return nums[len(nums)]  # Raises IndexError\n\n    1def access_last_element(nums):\n    2    return nums[len(nums)]  # Raises IndexError\n\nThis code raises an IndexError because it attempts to access an index that is one past the end of the array. The correct approach is to subtract one from the length.\n\nPython\n\n    def access_last_element(nums):\n        return nums[len(nums) - 1]  # Correct\n\n    1def access_last_element(nums):\n    2    return nums[len(nums) - 1]  # Correct\n\nIn programming languages with static arrays, like [C++](https://interviewing.io/cplusplus-interview-questions)\n or [Java](https://interviewing.io/java-interview-questions)\n, an array out of bounds is a common issue. However, [Python's](https://interviewing.io/python-interview-questions)\n dynamic arrays (lists) mostly circumvent this issue. Still, you can encounter similar problems if you try to insert or update an element at an index that does not exist in the list.\n\npython\n\n    def insert_at_index(nums, index, value):\n        nums[index] = value  # Raises IndexError if index > len(nums) - 1\n\n    1def insert_at_index(nums, index, value):\n    2    nums[index] = value  # Raises IndexError if index > len(nums) - 1\n\nA better solution would be to use the `list.insert()` method, which automatically handles these cases. If the provided index is beyond the current list length, the `insert()` method appends the element to the end of the list.\n\nPython\n\n    def insert_at_index(nums, index, value):\n         nums.insert(index, value)  # Inserts at correct index or appends if index > len(nums) - 1\n    \n\n    1def insert_at_index(nums, index, value):\n    2     nums.insert(index, value)  # Inserts at correct index or appends if index > len(nums) - 1\n    3\n\n### Inadequate Complexity Analysis\n\nNeglecting the analysis of time and space complexity is a common mistake. This can lead to suboptimal solutions or even solutions that exceed the time limit for larger inputs. For example, suppose you are given an array of numbers and asked to return an array of the same length where each element is the product of all numbers in the original array except the number at that index. The brute-force approach would look something like this:\n\npython\n\n    def product_except_self(nums):\n        output = []\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            product = 1\n            for j in range(len(nums)):\n                if i != j:\n                    product *= nums[j]\n            output.append(product)\n        return output\n\n    1def product_except_self(nums):\n    2    output = []\n    3    for i in range(len(nums)):\n    4        product = 1\n    5        for j in range(len(nums)):\n    6            if i != j:\n    7                product *= nums[j]\n    8        output.append(product)\n    9    return output\n\nThis naive solution has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, which could be too slow for larger inputs. An optimal solution with a time complexity of `O(n)` can be achieved by using two passes of the array: one pass to calculate the product of elements to the left of each element and a second pass to calculate the product of elements to the right of each element.\n\nPython\n\n    def product_except_self(nums):\n        n = len(nums)\n        output = [1] * n\n        left_product = right_product = 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            output[i] *= left_product\n            left_product *= nums[i]\n            output[~i] *= right_product\n            right_product *= nums[~i]\n        return output\n\n    1def product_except_self(nums):\n    2    n = len(nums)\n    3    output = [1] * n\n    4    left_product = right_product = 1\n    5    for i in range(n):\n    6        output[i] *= left_product\n    7        left_product *= nums[i]\n    8        output[~i] *= right_product\n    9        right_product *= nums[~i]\n    10    return output\n\n### Mishandling Special Cases and Input Assumptions\n\nFailing to handle special cases, like empty inputs, null values, or duplicate values, is a frequent pitfall. This can lead to unintended exceptions or incorrect outputs.\n\nFor instance, if you're writing a function to find the maximum element in an array and you do not consider the case where the array is empty, your function may throw an error.\n\npython\n\n    def find_max(nums):\n        return max(nums)  # Raises ValueError if nums is empty\n\n    1def find_max(nums):\n    2    return max(nums)  # Raises ValueError if nums is empty\n\nSimilarly in JavaScript, the following code will return `-Infinity` if the input array is empty:\n\nPython\n\n    function max_element(nums) {\n        return Math.max(...nums);\n    }\n    \n    console.log(max_element([])); // prints -Infinity\n\n    1function max_element(nums) {\n    2    return Math.max(...nums);\n    3}\n    4\n    5console.log(max_element([])); // prints -Infinity\n\nAnother example, if you were asked to write a function that takes an array and returns a new array with duplicates removed, you might write something like this:\n\npython\n\n    def remove_duplicates(nums):\n        return list(set(nums))\n\n    1def remove_duplicates(nums):\n    2    return list(set(nums))\n\nThis works well for most cases, but the solution doesn't preserve the original order of elements, which could be a requirement in some cases. This highlights the importance of asking clarifying questions about the input and output requirements before implementing your solution.\n\nPython\n\n    def remove_duplicates(nums):\n        seen = set()\n        result = []\n        for num in nums:\n            if num not in seen:\n                seen.add(num)\n                result.append(num)\n        return result\n\n    1def remove_duplicates(nums):\n    2    seen = set()\n    3    result = []\n    4    for num in nums:\n    5        if num not in seen:\n    6            seen.add(num)\n    7            result.append(num)\n    8    return result\n\n### Misuse of Built-in Functions\n\nMost programming languages have many helpful built-in functions and methods for working with arrays. However, it's crucial to understand their time complexities to avoid performance issues. One common misconception is thinking that searching for an element in an array (or list in Python) is an `O(1)` operation when in reality it's `O(n)` due to linear search.\n\nA particularly common example of this misunderstanding involves the use of the `in` keyword in Python, which is frequently used in array operations:\n\npython\n\n    if x in my_list:  # this might appear O(1), but it's actually O(n)!\n        pass\n    \n\n    1if x in my_list:  # this might appear O(1), but it's actually O(n)!\n    2    pass\n    3\n\nAnother example is the misuse of the `list.remove()` function in Python, which has a time complexity of `O(n)` because it has to shift all the elements after the removed element. If you are unaware of this, you might incorrectly assume it's an `O(1)` operation, leading to inefficient code.\n\nPython\n\n    def remove_all_instances(nums, val):\n        while val in nums: # Each 'in' check is O(n) and 'remove' is also O(n)\n            nums.remove(val)\n\n    1def remove_all_instances(nums, val):\n    2    while val in nums: # Each 'in' check is O(n) and 'remove' is also O(n)\n    3        nums.remove(val)\n\nTo resolve this, you could use a different approach, such as filtering the array using list comprehension, which results in a single pass over the array (i.e., `O(n)`):\n\npython\n\n    def remove_all_instances(nums, val):\n        return [num for num in nums if num != val] # Single pass, hence O(n)\n\n    1def remove_all_instances(nums, val):\n    2    return [num for num in nums if num != val] # Single pass, hence O(n)\n\n### Underutilizing Language Helpers\n\nWe have talked about misuse of built-in functions, but when to use them is also important to know. For example, suppose you are given an array of integers and asked to return the sum of all the elements. You might be tempted to write a for loop to iterate over the array and calculate the sum. However, Python has a built-in function called `sum()` that does exactly that. Using this function is not only more concise, but it also results in better performance because it's implemented in C.\n\nPython\n\n    def sum_array(nums):\n        total = 0\n        for num in nums:\n            total += num\n        return total\n    \n    # Can be written as\n    \n    def sum_array(nums):\n        return sum(nums)\n\n    1def sum_array(nums):\n    2    total = 0\n    3    for num in nums:\n    4        total += num\n    5    return total\n    6\n    7# Can be written as\n    8\n    9def sum_array(nums):\n    10    return sum(nums)\n\nAnother example could be when you want to reverse an array. You could write a for loop to iterate over the array and swap the elements, but Python has built-in functions that let you do this in a single line. You can choose between in-place reversal with `my_list.reverse()` or creating a new reversed list with `mylist[::-1]`. Knowing the language helpers available to you and using them when appropriate is important.\n\n### Using Array as a Queue\n\nArrays are efficient for accessing elements at specific indices but inefficient when removing or inserting elements at arbitrary positions. This is because these operations typically require shifting many elements, which is a linear time operation. For instance, using an array like a queue and popping from the front involves shifting all the remaining elements each time an element is popped, a `O(n)` operation.\n\nIn Python, the `pop()` method without any arguments efficiently removes the last element (`O(1)`) because Python maintains a pointer to the end of the list. However, using `pop(0)` to remove from the front leads to a linear-time operation (`O(n)`), as all remaining elements need to be shifted to fill the gap left by the removed element.\n\npython\n\n    def pop_front(nums):\n        return nums.pop(0) # Inefficient if nums is large\n\n    1def pop_front(nums):\n    2    return nums.pop(0) # Inefficient if nums is large\n\nA better approach would be to use a data structure that supports efficient removal from the front, like a deque in Python.\n\nPython\n\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    def pop_front(nums):\n        dq = deque(nums)\n        return dq.popleft()  # Efficient\n    \n\n    1from collections import deque\n    2\n    3def pop_front(nums):\n    4    dq = deque(nums)\n    5    return dq.popleft()  # Efficient\n    6\n\nAnother example could be taken from JavaScript where built-in support for Queue is not available. In such cases, you can use an array as a queue, but you should be aware of the trade-offs and mention them to your interviewer. If they ask, you should know how to implement a Queue in JavaScript, which is efficient for both enqueue and dequeue operations.\n\n### Array Resizing Misconceptions\n\nIn many programming languages, dynamic arrays or lists automatically resize when elements are appended beyond their current capacity. This, however, is not a constant time `O(1)` operation as one might initially believe. When a resize occurs, what typically happens under the hood is the creation of a new, larger array, and all the elements from the old array are copied over to this new one.\n\npython\n\n    def append_elements(nums, elements_to_add):\n        for element in elements_to_add:\n            nums.append(element)  # Most of the time O(1), but sometimes O(n)\n\n    1def append_elements(nums, elements_to_add):\n    2    for element in elements_to_add:\n    3        nums.append(element)  # Most of the time O(1), but sometimes O(n)\n\nThis example, although written in Python, mirrors the same principle in other languages that support dynamic arrays, such as JavaScript and Java (with `ArrayList`). If you are unaware of this concept, you might wrongly assume that appending is always an `O(1)` operation. It's worth noting that on average we can say it is an amortized `O(1)` but this means occasionally we will pay a linear cost for this.\n\nBeing mindful of this underlying detail can help you write more efficient code and make better decisions about which data structures to use for specific problems. For instance, if you often need to add elements to an array, and the total number of elements is known in advance, it might be more efficient to preallocate the array with a fixed size if your language supports it. This knowledge can also assist in understanding the trade-offs between dynamic and static arrays.\n\n### Limited Familiarity with Constructing Graphs Using Arrays\n\nGraphs are a versatile and essential data structure in computer science, often used to model various real-world problems. They are typically represented in two common ways: adjacency matrices and adjacency lists. A common pitfall is not fully understanding how to construct and manipulate these graph representations using arrays.\n\nAn adjacency matrix, a 2D array, represents a finite graph. The matrix elements indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. However, adjacency matrices can be inefficient for large graphs with many vertices but few edges due to the storage of many zero values.\n\n![A graph represented by an adjacency matrix](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/arrays_3_f434f2a58c.png)\n\nPython\n\n    # Graph represented as an adjacency matrix\n    #         0  1  2  3\n    graph = [[0, 1, 0, 0], #0\\\n             [1, 0, 1, 1], #1\\\n             [0, 1, 0, 1], #2\\\n             [0, 1, 1, 0]] #3\n\n    1# Graph represented as an adjacency matrix\n    2#         0  1  2  3\n    3graph = [[0, 1, 0, 0], #0\\\n    4         [1, 0, 1, 1], #1\\\n    5         [0, 1, 0, 1], #2\\\n    6         [0, 1, 1, 0]] #3\n\nOn the other hand, an adjacency list uses a more space-efficient approach, especially for sparse graphs. It comprises an array of lists. The array's index represents the node, and each entry in its list represents the nodes it's connected to.\n\n![A graph represented by an adjacency list](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/arrays_4_f0dfcbeee0.png)\n\npython\n\n    # Graph represented as an adjacency list\n    graph = [[1],\\\n             [0, 2, 3],\\\n             [1, 3],\\\n             [1, 2]]\n\n    1# Graph represented as an adjacency list\n    2graph = [[1],\\\n    3         [0, 2, 3],\\\n    4         [1, 3],\\\n    5         [1, 2]]\n\nFinally, a matrix itself can be thought of as a graph in problems like [Number of Islands](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands)\n or [Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)\n.\n\nPython\n\n    # Graph represented by each cell being a thought of as a \"node\"\n    # so (0,0) has three neighbors (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1)\n    graph = [[1, 1, 1],\\\n             [0, 0, 0],\\\n             [1, 0, 1],\\\n             [1, 1, 1]]\n\n    1# Graph represented by each cell being a thought of as a \"node\"\n    2# so (0,0) has three neighbors (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1)\n    3graph = [[1, 1, 1],\\\n    4         [0, 0, 0],\\\n    5         [1, 0, 1],\\\n    6         [1, 1, 1]]\n\nClarifying Questions to Ask Your Interviewer About Arrays\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Using an In-place Algorithm\n\nIn-place operations refer to modifying the input data structure directly, instead of creating a new one. This tactic can significantly cut down the memory footprint of an algorithm, a distinct advantage when handling large data sets. However, in-place operations also modify the original data, which might not always be desirable. This is especially true if the original data is needed elsewhere in the program or if the problem requires maintaining the original input for future reference or backtracking purposes.\n\nTherefore, if you see a problem that can be solved in-place, a good question to ask your interviewer could be:\n\n\"_Can I modify the original array to save space, or should I maintain the original input?_\"\n\nThis shows that you know the trade-offs and are thinking about the problem holistically.\n\nPro tip: You can specifically ask \"_if the data structure is thread-safe or if we want to have our function avoid side effects as we might in the functional programming paradigm._\" These tend to be the two main objections why we would not modify a data structure in-place and also provide an interviewer with good signal that you understand why direct modification isn't always a good idea.\n\n### Proactive Edge-Case Handling and Understanding Input Specifics\n\nWhen you are dealing with numbers, always ask about their nature. Understanding the specifics of numerical input is key to formulating a robust solution. _Are the numbers positive, negative, odd, or even, or could there be null values? What is the range of the numbers? Are there any other constraints?_ It's essential to establish these details upfront or to state these assumptions at the beginning clearly. This habit can help avoid common errors, even the most glaring one – trying to solve the wrong problem.\n\nEqually critical is the proactive exploration of edge cases. Think of zero values, empty arrays, or unexpected data types. It's not just about solving the problem but also about how you handle every possible scenario. Ignoring edge cases can indicate a lack of attention to detail, impacting your interview results.\n\n### Memory Management\n\nIn real-world applications, you may need to handle arrays that are too large to fit into memory. You need to design a strategy to process such arrays in chunks, ensuring that only a manageable portion of the array is loaded into memory at any time. An example could be importing data from a large file.\n\nYou could ask, \"_What is the maximum size of the array? Should I design the solution to handle very large arrays?_\" These clarifications can help you understand the scale at which your solution will be applied.\n\n### Algorithm Selection and Time-Space Complexity\n\nSelecting the right algorithm is crucial to solving a problem effectively. This decision often involves trading off between time and space complexity. For example, if you're tasked with finding a target sum from any two numbers in an array, different approaches offer different trade-offs. A brute-force approach has `O(n^2)` time complexity but doesn't require extra space. Using a hash table improves the time complexity to `O(n)` but requires additional space.\n\nYou can ask your interviewer, \"_Can I use extra space to speed up the computation?_\" These clarifications can help guide your algorithm selection.\n\n### Understanding the Problem's Characteristics / Is the Array Sorted?\n\nA deep understanding of the problem's constraints and characteristics can guide you toward a more effective and efficient solution. An essential part of this is understanding the nature of the array you're working with. Is it sorted? Are there duplicates? Can it be sorted, and if so, does that offer any benefits for your specific problem?\n\nAsking these questions can lead to insights that significantly optimize your solution. For example, if the array is already sorted, or if you have the freedom to sort it, you could use binary search for various operations, which is typically more efficient than linear search.\n\nTake a problem where you need to find if a target value exists in an array. If the array is not sorted, you would typically resort to a linear search with a time complexity of `O(n)`. However, if the array is sorted or can be sorted, you can utilize a binary search algorithm, which reduces the time complexity to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Understanding Data Structures: Arrays vs Linked Lists\n\nA common question that comes up when discussing arrays is: \"_Why are arrays commonly used in vector implementations despite the high cost of resizing?_\" The answer lies in their efficiency for certain operations, especially accessing elements. However, the trade-off is the high cost during resizing, which involves copying all elements to a new array.\n\nUnlike arrays, linked lists, despite lacking efficient random access and causing cache locality issues, excel when frequent insertions and deletions occur. Understanding when to employ arrays versus linked lists, like in an LRU cache scenario, is a mark of mastery. It is crucial to recognize these nuances to make optimal problem-solving decisions.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIn essence, arrays are foundational data structures that are pivotal when dealing with fixed-size data sets. Indeed, arrays, in their simplicity, can present complex challenges that require careful navigation. By understanding common mistakes, one can deftly avoid pitfalls. Additionally, demonstrating mastery in an interview isn't just about solving problems - it involves asking the right clarifying questions and understanding the implications of algorithm choices. Mastery comes from deep understanding, keen attention to detail, and a practiced ability to apply this knowledge in diverse scenarios.\n\nCommon Array interview Questions\n--------------------------------\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Reverse Words in a String](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-words-in-a-string)\n\n[Given an input string \\`s\\`, reverse the order of the words without reversing the words themselves.](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-words-in-a-string)\n\nHARD\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Binary Array Partition](https://interviewing.io/questions/binary-array-partition)\n\n[Given an array Z of 0s and 1s, divide the array into 3 non-empty parts, such that all of these parts represent the same binary value.](https://interviewing.io/questions/binary-array-partition)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Top K Frequent Elements](https://interviewing.io/questions/top-k-frequent-elements)\n\n[Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.](https://interviewing.io/questions/top-k-frequent-elements)\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Lucky Numbers in a Matrix](https://interviewing.io/questions/lucky-numbers-in-a-matrix)\n\n[Given an m x n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.](https://interviewing.io/questions/lucky-numbers-in-a-matrix)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-subarrays-with-bounded-maximum)\n\n[Given an integer array nums and two integers left and right, return the number of contiguous non-empty subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is in the range \\[left, right\\].](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-subarrays-with-bounded-maximum)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Number of Islands](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands)\n\n[Given a 2D matrix, where \"1\" represents land and \"0\" represents water, count how many islands are present.](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://interviewing.io/questions/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)\n\n[Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.](https://interviewing.io/questions/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Container With the Most Water](https://interviewing.io/questions/container-with-most-water)\n\n[Given n non-negative integers, find two lines that form a container that can hold the most amount of water.](https://interviewing.io/questions/container-with-most-water)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Build a Max Heap From an Array](https://interviewing.io/questions/build-a-max-heap)\n\n[Given an array of integers, transform the array in-place to a max heap.](https://interviewing.io/questions/build-a-max-heap)\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Two Sum](https://interviewing.io/questions/two-sum)\n\n[Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a given target.](https://interviewing.io/questions/two-sum)\n\nEASY\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Reverse a Linked List](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-linked-list)\n\n[Given the head of a linked list, reverse the list and return the new head.](https://interviewing.io/questions/reverse-linked-list)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Meeting Rooms](https://interviewing.io/questions/meeting-rooms)\n\n[Given a list of meetings, represented as tuples with a start and an end time, determine the minimum number of rooms required to schedule all the meetings.](https://interviewing.io/questions/meeting-rooms)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Kth Smallest Element](https://interviewing.io/questions/kth-smallest-element)\n\n[Given an integer array and an integer k, return the kth smallest element in the array.](https://interviewing.io/questions/kth-smallest-element)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Partition List](https://interviewing.io/questions/partition-list)\n\n[Given a list of integers L and a number K, write a function that reorganizes L into three partitions: elements less than K, elements equal to K, and elements greater than K.

          "content": "### Types of Arrays\n\nArrays come in different shapes and sizes. Let's use an analogy to understand the different types of arrays.\n\nThe simplest and most common type is the one-dimensional array, similar to a row of houses on the street. This type of array consists of elements stored in a contiguous block of memory, much like houses lined up side by side. Each house, like an array element, has its unique address or index. The 'length' of this street or array is simply the count of houses or elements it hosts.\n\n![An array is like a row of houses. The house number represents the address of each row item. Each house represents the item itself.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/arrays_1_71c15c886f.png)\n\nElevating complexity, a two-dimensional array mirrors a city grid. Streets and avenues form a grid, each housing numerous homes. Each home's location can be identified using its street and house number, similar to a two-dimensional array's pair of indices. The total count of houses across the city grid corresponds to the total elements in the array.\n\n![Alt - A two-dimensional array is like a city grid. A street and house number identify each house.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/arrays_2_073571964f.png)\n\nFor a three-dimensional array, picture a towering skyscraper in the city grid. Each floor is its own grid of streets and houses. Every apartment (element) is located using a floor number, street number, and house number, much like multiple indices in a multidimensional array. The total number of apartments across all the floors reflects the total elements within the array. While you can have an array with an arbitrary number of dimensions, in coding interviews it is rare to see more than three dimensions used.",

          "content": "### Array Operations\n\nArrays are best used when accessing an element by its index. This is a constant time `O(1)` operation. This is the primary benefit of arrays over other data structures like [linked lists](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n, where finding a specific element necessitates traversing the list, resulting in a linear time `O(n)` operation. However, the insertion or deletion of elements might not be as efficient, given that all the elements to the right or left of the insertion or deletion point must be shifted. This is also a linear time `O(n)` operation. Similarly, if you’re searching for an element in an unsorted array, you’ll have to examine the entire array, which is also a linear time `O(n)` operation. However, the story changes if the array is sorted.

However, its versatility lies in its simplicity. It's akin to human cells: simple in isolation, yet they form complex organisms when combined.\n\nArrays form the backbone of many interview questions, whether they revolve around [sorting](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n, [searching](https://interviewing.io/search-interview-questions)\n, [dynamic programming](https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions)\n, or other algorithmic concepts. They are often employed in scenarios where storing and accessing elements in a sequential or ordered manner is required. This includes [strings](https://interviewing.io/strings-interview-questions)\n, which are fundamentally just arrays of characters under the hood. Arrays also prove helpful when there's a need for constant-time access to elements based on their index.\n\nHere are some instances when you can use arrays in interviews.",

Since elements in an array are laid out contiguously and have a unique index, iterating over them in any given order (forward, backward, or even at irregular intervals) is quite straightforward.\n\nSuppose you are given a coding challenge during an interview where you are asked to square every array element in place. Such operations can be performed efficiently thanks to arrays, as we can access and modify each element via its index.\n\nHere's how you might implement this in Python:\n\nPython\n\n    def square_array(arr):\n        for i in range(len(arr)):\n            arr[i] = arr[i] * arr[i]\n        return arr\n\n    1def square_array(arr):\n    2    for i in range(len(arr)):\n    3        arr[i] = arr[i] * arr[i]\n    4    return arr\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that when the order of elements doesn't matter, other data structures such as sets or maps can be more appropriate, offering unique benefits like constant-time lookups and insertions, depending on the specific scenario.",

In interview scenarios, understanding various sorting algorithms and their efficiencies is critical. An array can be an intuitive choice when we need to sort elements, whether integers or objects, in a specific order.\n\nConsider an example where you have an array of integers; the task is to sort this array in ascending order. Most languages provide a built-in function that can be used to sort arrays. In Python, we have both the `sort()` and `sorted()` functions available for this purpose. The `sort()` method sorts the array in-place, meaning it modifies the original array:\n\nPython\n\n    def sort_elements(arr):\n        arr.sort()\n        return arr\n\n    1def sort_elements(arr):\n    2    arr.sort()\n    3    return arr\n\nOn the other hand, the `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence, leaving the original sequence unaffected. It's beneficial when you want to keep the original array intact and need a sorted version of it.\n\nRead more about sorting algorithms in our [Sorting guide](https://interviewing.io/sorting-interview-questions)\n.",

          "content": "### Searching for an Element in a Sorted Collection\n\nWhen you are given a sorted collection, binary search may be an effective solution. Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used for searching in a sorted array. It halves the search space at every step, making it highly efficient with `O(log n)` time complexity. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful or the remaining half is empty.\n\nArrays are particularly useful when performing a binary search, as they provide constant-time access to the item in the middle of the array. Compare this to a linked list, where you'd have to traverse the list to find the middle element, which would take linear time.\n\nPython\n\n    def binary_search(arr, x):\n        low = 0\n        high = len(arr) - 1\n        mid = 0\n    \n        while low <= high:\n    \n            mid = (high + low) // 2\n    \n            # If x is greater, ignore left half\n            if arr[mid] < x:\n                low = mid + 1\n    \n            # If x is smaller, ignore right half\n            elif arr[mid] > x:\n                high = mid - 1\n    \n            # x is present at mid\n            else:\n                return mid\n    \n        # If we reach here, then the element was not present\n        return -1\n\n    1def binary_search(arr, x):\n    2    low = 0\n    3    high = len(arr) - 1\n    4    mid = 0\n    5\n    6    while low <= high:\n    7\n    8        mid = (high + low) // 2\n    9\n    10        # If x is greater, ignore left half\n    11        if arr[mid] < x:\n    12            low = mid + 1\n    13\n    14        # If x is smaller, ignore right half\n    15        elif arr[mid] > x:\n    16            high = mid - 1\n    17\n    18        # x is present at mid\n    19        else:\n    20            return mid\n    21\n    22    # If we reach here, then the element was not present\n    23    return -1\n\nBinary search seems straightforward in concept, but questions on this topic come in various forms and complexities. Some problems ask you to find the first or last occurrence of a number, and others require you to find the smallest or largest number that meets a specific condition. Thus, it is essential to practice a diverse set of problems on binary search to recognize its patterns and application in different scenarios.",

          "content": "### Two Pointers\n\n\"[Two Pointers](https://interviewing.io/two-pointers-interview-questions)\n\" is a common technique for solving array problems, especially when dealing with sequential access or when there's a need to keep track of two places in the array simultaneously. The two pointers might move in the same direction, opposite directions, or one might remain stationary while the other moves; the specific pattern depends on the problem.\n\nA classic example is reversing an array in-place. We position pointers at the start and end of the array and swap the corresponding elements. These pointers then converge towards the center, effectively reversing the array in-place.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\npython\n\n    def reverse_array(arr):\n        start = 0\n        end = len(arr) - 1\n    \n        while start < end:\n            arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n            start += 1\n            end -= 1\n    \n        return arr\n\n    1def reverse_array(arr):\n    2    start = 0\n    3    end = len(arr) - 1\n    4\n    5    while start < end:\n    6        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n    7        start += 1\n    8        end -= 1\n    9\n    10    return arr\n\nIt is worth nothing that this approach is applicable to strings as well. However, as strings are treated as immutable in many languages, including Python, we can't perform in-place operations on them directly. In such scenarios, we can convert the string to a list (which is mutable), perform the in-place reversal, and then convert it back to a string.\n\nThe utility of this technique is quite broad,for instance, in detecting palindromes or solving the two-sum problem. Mastery of this approach not only aids in array-related queries but also extends to solving linked list related problems, such as identifying the middle element or detecting a cycle within the list.",

          "content": "### Off-by-One Errors and Array Out of Bounds\n\nOff-by-one errors, also known as OBOEs, are among the most common errors. These typically happen when indexing arrays, especially in languages that use zero-based indexing, like Python and Java (There are a number of languages that use one-based indexing as well, such as Lua, R, Julia, COBOL, etc.) For example, suppose you are given an array; and you need to access the last element. It’s common to see mistakes like this:\n\npython\n\n    def access_last_element(nums):\n        return nums[len(nums)]  # Raises IndexError\n\n    1def access_last_element(nums):\n    2    return nums[len(nums)]  # Raises IndexError\n\nThis code raises an IndexError because it attempts to access an index that is one past the end of the array. The correct approach is to subtract one from the length.\n\nPython\n\n    def access_last_element(nums):\n        return nums[len(nums) - 1]  # Correct\n\n    1def access_last_element(nums):\n    2    return nums[len(nums) - 1]  # Correct\n\nIn programming languages with static arrays, like [C++](https://interviewing.io/cplusplus-interview-questions)\n or [Java](https://interviewing.io/java-interview-questions)\n, an array out of bounds is a common issue. However, [Python's](https://interviewing.io/python-interview-questions)\n dynamic arrays (lists) mostly circumvent this issue. Still, you can encounter similar problems if you try to insert or update an element at an index that does not exist in the list.\n\npython\n\n    def insert_at_index(nums, index, value):\n        nums[index] = value  # Raises IndexError if index > len(nums) - 1\n\n    1def insert_at_index(nums, index, value):\n    2    nums[index] = value  # Raises IndexError if index > len(nums) - 1\n\nA better solution would be to use the `list.insert()` method, which automatically handles these cases. If the provided index is beyond the current list length, the `insert()` method appends the element to the end of the list.\n\nPython\n\n    def insert_at_index(nums, index, value):\n         nums.insert(index, value)  # Inserts at correct index or appends if index > len(nums) - 1\n    \n\n    1def insert_at_index(nums, index, value):\n    2     nums.insert(index, value)  # Inserts at correct index or appends if index > len(nums) - 1\n    3",

This can lead to suboptimal solutions or even solutions that exceed the time limit for larger inputs. For example, suppose you are given an array of numbers and asked to return an array of the same length where each element is the product of all numbers in the original array except the number at that index. The brute-force approach would look something like this:\n\npython\n\n    def product_except_self(nums):\n        output = []\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            product = 1\n            for j in range(len(nums)):\n                if i != j:\n                    product *= nums[j]\n            output.append(product)\n        return output\n\n    1def product_except_self(nums):\n    2    output = []\n    3    for i in range(len(nums)):\n    4        product = 1\n    5        for j in range(len(nums)):\n    6            if i != j:\n    7                product *= nums[j]\n    8        output.append(product)\n    9    return output\n\nThis naive solution has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, which could be too slow for larger inputs. An optimal solution with a time complexity of `O(n)` can be achieved by using two passes of the array: one pass to calculate the product of elements to the left of each element and a second pass to calculate the product of elements to the right of each element.\n\nPython\n\n    def product_except_self(nums):\n        n = len(nums)\n        output = [1] * n\n        left_product = right_product = 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            output[i] *= left_product\n            left_product *= nums[i]\n            output[~i] *= right_product\n            right_product *= nums[~i]\n        return output\n\n    1def product_except_self(nums):\n    2    n = len(nums)\n    3    output = [1] * n\n    4    left_product = right_product = 1\n    5    for i in range(n):\n    6        output[i] *= left_product\n    7        left_product *= nums[i]\n    8        output[~i] *= right_product\n    9        right_product *= nums[~i]\n    10    return output",

This can lead to unintended exceptions or incorrect outputs.\n\nFor instance, if you're writing a function to find the maximum element in an array and you do not consider the case where the array is empty, your function may throw an error.\n\npython\n\n    def find_max(nums):\n        return max(nums)  # Raises ValueError if nums is empty\n\n    1def find_max(nums):\n    2    return max(nums)  # Raises ValueError if nums is empty\n\nSimilarly in JavaScript, the following code will return `-Infinity` if the input array is empty:\n\nPython\n\n    function max_element(nums) {\n        return Math.max(...nums);\n    }\n    \n    console.log(max_element([])); // prints -Infinity\n\n    1function max_element(nums) {\n    2    return Math.max(...nums);\n    3}\n    4\n    5console.log(max_element([])); // prints -Infinity\n\nAnother example, if you were asked to write a function that takes an array and returns a new array with duplicates removed, you might write something like this:\n\npython\n\n    def remove_duplicates(nums):\n        return list(set(nums))\n\n    1def remove_duplicates(nums):\n    2    return list(set(nums))\n\nThis works well for most cases, but the solution doesn't preserve the original order of elements, which could be a requirement in some cases. This highlights the importance of asking clarifying questions about the input and output requirements before implementing your solution.\n\nPython\n\n    def remove_duplicates(nums):\n        seen = set()\n        result = []\n        for num in nums:\n            if num not in seen:\n                seen.add(num)\n                result.append(num)\n        return result\n\n    1def remove_duplicates(nums):\n    2    seen = set()\n    3    result = []\n    4    for num in nums:\n    5        if num not in seen:\n    6            seen.add(num)\n    7            result.append(num)\n    8    return result",

However, it's crucial to understand their time complexities to avoid performance issues. One common misconception is thinking that searching for an element in an array (or list in Python) is an `O(1)` operation when in reality it's `O(n)` due to linear search.\n\nA particularly common example of this misunderstanding involves the use of the `in` keyword in Python, which is frequently used in array operations:\n\npython\n\n    if x in my_list:  # this might appear O(1), but it's actually O(n)!\n        pass\n    \n\n    1if x in my_list:  # this might appear O(1), but it's actually O(n)!\n    2    pass\n    3\n\nAnother example is the misuse of the `list.remove()` function in Python, which has a time complexity of `O(n)` because it has to shift all the elements after the removed element. If you are unaware of this, you might incorrectly assume it's an `O(1)` operation, leading to inefficient code.\n\nPython\n\n    def remove_all_instances(nums, val):\n        while val in nums: # Each 'in' check is O(n) and 'remove' is also O(n)\n            nums.remove(val)\n\n    1def remove_all_instances(nums, val):\n    2    while val in nums: # Each 'in' check is O(n) and 'remove' is also O(n)\n    3        nums.remove(val)\n\nTo resolve this, you could use a different approach, such as filtering the array using list comprehension, which results in a single pass over the array (i.e., `O(n)`):\n\npython\n\n    def remove_all_instances(nums, val):\n        return [num for num in nums if num != val] # Single pass, hence O(n)\n\n    1def remove_all_instances(nums, val):\n    2    return [num for num in nums if num != val] # Single pass, hence O(n)",

          "content": "### Underutilizing Language Helpers\n\nWe have talked about misuse of built-in functions, but when to use them is also important to know. For example, suppose you are given an array of integers and asked to return the sum of all the elements. You might be tempted to write a for loop to iterate over the array and calculate the sum. However, Python has a built-in function called `sum()` that does exactly that. Using this function is not only more concise, but it also results in better performance because it's implemented in C.\n\nPython\n\n    def sum_array(nums):\n        total = 0\n        for num in nums:\n            total += num\n        return total\n    \n    # Can be written as\n    \n    def sum_array(nums):\n        return sum(nums)\n\n    1def sum_array(nums):\n    2    total = 0\n    3    for num in nums:\n    4        total += num\n    5    return total\n    6\n    7# Can be written as\n    8\n    9def sum_array(nums):\n    10    return sum(nums)\n\nAnother example could be when you want to reverse an array. You could write a for loop to iterate over the array and swap the elements, but Python has built-in functions that let you do this in a single line. You can choose between in-place reversal with `my_list.reverse()` or creating a new reversed list with `mylist[::-1]`. Knowing the language helpers available to you and using them when appropriate is important.",

          "content": "### Using Array as a Queue\n\nArrays are efficient for accessing elements at specific indices but inefficient when removing or inserting elements at arbitrary positions. This is because these operations typically require shifting many elements, which is a linear time operation. For instance, using an array like a queue and popping from the front involves shifting all the remaining elements each time an element is popped, a `O(n)` operation.\n\nIn Python, the `pop()` method without any arguments efficiently removes the last element (`O(1)`) because Python maintains a pointer to the end of the list. However, using `pop(0)` to remove from the front leads to a linear-time operation (`O(n)`), as all remaining elements need to be shifted to fill the gap left by the removed element.\n\npython\n\n    def pop_front(nums):\n        return nums.pop(0) # Inefficient if nums is large\n\n    1def pop_front(nums):\n    2    return nums.pop(0) # Inefficient if nums is large\n\nA better approach would be to use a data structure that supports efficient removal from the front, like a deque in Python.\n\nPython\n\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    def pop_front(nums):\n        dq = deque(nums)\n        return dq.popleft()  # Efficient\n    \n\n    1from collections import deque\n    2\n    3def pop_front(nums):\n    4    dq = deque(nums)\n    5    return dq.popleft()  # Efficient\n    6\n\nAnother example could be taken from JavaScript where built-in support for Queue is not available. In such cases, you can use an array as a queue, but you should be aware of the trade-offs and mention them to your interviewer. If they ask, you should know how to implement a Queue in JavaScript, which is efficient for both enqueue and dequeue operations.",

          "content": "### Array Resizing Misconceptions\n\nIn many programming languages, dynamic arrays or lists automatically resize when elements are appended beyond their current capacity. This, however, is not a constant time `O(1)` operation as one might initially believe. When a resize occurs, what typically happens under the hood is the creation of a new, larger array, and all the elements from the old array are copied over to this new one.\n\npython\n\n    def append_elements(nums, elements_to_add):\n        for element in elements_to_add:\n            nums.append(element)  # Most of the time O(1), but sometimes O(n)\n\n    1def append_elements(nums, elements_to_add):\n    2    for element in elements_to_add:\n    3        nums.append(element)  # Most of the time O(1), but sometimes O(n)\n\nThis example, although written in Python, mirrors the same principle in other languages that support dynamic arrays, such as JavaScript and Java (with `ArrayList`). If you are unaware of this concept, you might wrongly assume that appending is always an `O(1)` operation. It's worth noting that on average we can say it is an amortized `O(1)` but this means occasionally we will pay a linear cost for this.\n\nBeing mindful of this underlying detail can help you write more efficient code and make better decisions about which data structures to use for specific problems. For instance, if you often need to add elements to an array, and the total number of elements is known in advance, it might be more efficient to preallocate the array with a fixed size if your language supports it. This knowledge can also assist in understanding the trade-offs between dynamic and static arrays.",

They are typically represented in two common ways: adjacency matrices and adjacency lists. A common pitfall is not fully understanding how to construct and manipulate these graph representations using arrays.\n\nAn adjacency matrix, a 2D array, represents a finite graph. The matrix elements indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. However, adjacency matrices can be inefficient for large graphs with many vertices but few edges due to the storage of many zero values.\n\n![A graph represented by an adjacency matrix](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/arrays_3_f434f2a58c.png)\n\nPython\n\n    # Graph represented as an adjacency matrix\n    #         0  1  2  3\n    graph = [[0, 1, 0, 0], #0\\\n             [1, 0, 1, 1], #1\\\n             [0, 1, 0, 1], #2\\\n             [0, 1, 1, 0]] #3\n\n    1# Graph represented as an adjacency matrix\n    2#         0  1  2  3\n    3graph = [[0, 1, 0, 0], #0\\\n    4         [1, 0, 1, 1], #1\\\n    5         [0, 1, 0, 1], #2\\\n    6         [0, 1, 1, 0]] #3\n\nOn the other hand, an adjacency list uses a more space-efficient approach, especially for sparse graphs. It comprises an array of lists. The array's index represents the node, and each entry in its list represents the nodes it's connected to.\n\n![A graph represented by an adjacency list](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/arrays_4_f0dfcbeee0.png)\n\npython\n\n    # Graph represented as an adjacency list\n    graph = [[1],\\\n             [0, 2, 3],\\\n             [1, 3],\\\n             [1, 2]]\n\n    1# Graph represented as an adjacency list\n    2graph = [[1],\\\n    3         [0, 2, 3],\\\n    4         [1, 3],\\\n    5         [1, 2]]\n\nFinally, a matrix itself can be thought of as a graph in problems like [Number of Islands](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands)\n or [Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)\n.\n\nPython\n\n    # Graph represented by each cell being a thought of as a \"node\"\n    # so (0,0) has three neighbors (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1)\n    graph = [[1, 1, 1],\\\n             [0, 0, 0],\\\n             [1, 0, 1],\\\n             [1, 1, 1]]\n\n    1# Graph represented by each cell being a thought of as a \"node\"\n    2# so (0,0) has three neighbors (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1)\n    3graph = [[1, 1, 1],\\\n    4         [0, 0, 0],\\\n    5         [1, 0, 1],\\\n    6         [1, 1, 1]]\n\nClarifying Questions to Ask Your Interviewer About Arrays\n---------------------------------------------------------",

This tactic can significantly cut down the memory footprint of an algorithm, a distinct advantage when handling large data sets. However, in-place operations also modify the original data, which might not always be desirable. This is especially true if the original data is needed elsewhere in the program or if the problem requires maintaining the original input for future reference or backtracking purposes.\n\nTherefore, if you see a problem that can be solved in-place, a good question to ask your interviewer could be:\n\n\"_Can I modify the original array to save space, or should I maintain the original input?_\"\n\nThis shows that you know the trade-offs and are thinking about the problem holistically.\n\nPro tip: You can specifically ask \"_if the data structure is thread-safe or if we want to have our function avoid side effects as we might in the functional programming paradigm._\" These tend to be the two main objections why we would not modify a data structure in-place and also provide an interviewer with good signal that you understand why direct modification isn't always a good idea.",

What is the range of the numbers? Are there any other constraints?_ It's essential to establish these details upfront or to state these assumptions at the beginning clearly. This habit can help avoid common errors, even the most glaring one – trying to solve the wrong problem.\n\nEqually critical is the proactive exploration of edge cases.

An essential part of this is understanding the nature of the array you're working with. Is it sorted? Are there duplicates? Can it be sorted, and if so, does that offer any benefits for your specific problem?\n\nAsking these questions can lead to insights that significantly optimize your solution. For example, if the array is already sorted, or if you have the freedom to sort it, you could use binary search for various operations, which is typically more efficient than linear search.\n\nTake a problem where you need to find if a target value exists in an array. If the array is not sorted, you would typically resort to a linear search with a time complexity of `O(n)`. However, if the array is sorted or can be sorted, you can utilize a binary search algorithm, which reduces the time complexity to `O(log n)`.",

However, the trade-off is the high cost during resizing, which involves copying all elements to a new array.\n\nUnlike arrays, linked lists, despite lacking efficient random access and causing cache locality issues, excel when frequent insertions and deletions occur. Understanding when to employ arrays versus linked lists, like in an LRU cache scenario, is a mark of mastery. It is crucial to recognize these nuances to make optimal problem-solving decisions.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIn essence, arrays are foundational data structures that are pivotal when dealing with fixed-size data sets. Indeed, arrays, in their simplicity, can present complex challenges that require careful navigation. By understanding common mistakes, one can deftly avoid pitfalls. Additionally, demonstrating mastery in an interview isn't just about solving problems - it involves asking the right clarifying questions and understanding the implications of algorithm choices.

It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, narrowing down the potential locations of the item until either the item is found or it's established that the item isn't in the list. This method of halving the interval is what gives the algorithm its name – “binary” refers to the “two directions” we can choose to go during the algorithm.\n\nAt each step, the algorithm compares the middle element in the search space with the target value. If they are equal, it returns the index of the middle element. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues on the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater, the search continues on the upper half. The process continues until the search space is empty or the target element is found.\n\n![Binary Search looking for the number 17](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Leet_code_2_e0fa00535b.gif)\n\nThe beauty of binary search is in its time complexity - `O(log n)`, which makes it highly efficient for large datasets, significantly outperforming linear search methods that have a time complexity of `O(n)`.\n\nWhat's the Difference Between Binary Search and a Binary Search Tree?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBinary search is an algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array. A [binary search tree](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions#what-is-a-bst)\n, on the other hand, is a type of data structure that maintains elements in a manner where they can be searched, inserted, and deleted using the principles of binary search. Binary Search Trees aren't very common in interviews, but are worth knowing in case they show up.\n\n![Binary Search is an algorithm. A Binary Search Tree is a specially ordered Tree where you can apply the binary search algorithm.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/binary_search_and_binary_search_tree_854845e589.jpg)\n\nLogarithms\n----------\n\n### Why They Matter\n\nScared of logarithms? If you like most people, you probably haven't worked with logarithms for a very long time if you ever even did it in the first place!That's okay! All you really need to know is a small number of facts to be comfortable talking about them in interviews.\n\n*   Logarithms are expressed in this format: $log\\_b(n) = x$, where b is the base number, n is the number you want to transform, and x is the result. It says b raised to the power x equals n.\n*   In computer science, we pretty safely ignore the \"b\" (base) since it is likely to always be base 10 that we are working with. So instead of saying log\\_10(N), we just say log (N).\n*   The last and most important thing to know is that logs are an infinitesimally small number compared to the number you're taking the log of. For instance, take the number 1 trillion. That's a huge number, but log (1 trillion) is just 12!\n\nThe reason this is worth discussing is because many candidates don't appreciate the difference between time complexities involving logs. You've probably seen an example of time complexities plotted on a graph before, something like this:\n\n![Time Complexity Chart with Logs](https://everythingcomputerscience.com/images/Algorithm_Analysis731x524.jpg)\n\nThe graph illustrates three time complexities: `O(log N)`, `O(N)`, and `O(N log N)`. The difference in scale between `O(log N)` and `O(N)` is massive, not slight, as input sizes increase. This means if you can use a logarithmic algorithm it isn't \"slightly better than linear\" it is massively better. The operations needed for a logarithmic algorithm are infinitesimal compared to a linear algorithm.\n\n`O(N log N)` represents log-linear time complexity. Candidates occasionally find it difficult to remember where it falls on the spectrum of complexities, but it helps to remember the implicit multiplication in the notation. It isn't `O(N log N)` it is `O(N * log N)`. Thus, `O(N log N)` is larger than `O(N)` since we are multiplying it by something, yet it is still relatively small, as it's multiplied by the significantly smaller `O(log N)`.\n\n### Why Is Binary Search Logarithmic?\n\n_Repeatedly_ dividing something creates a logarithmic function (note the emphasis on the word **repeated** here). If you divide something once, it does not change the asymptotic nature of the function. This code below would still be considered linear, _not_ logarithmic:\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def linear(n):\n      for i in range(n/2):\n        print(i)\n    \n\n    1def linear(n):\n    2  for i in range(n/2):\n    3    print(i)\n    4\n\nBut if we are repeatedly dividing something, we are doing something inherently logarithmic with it. See the below code as an example:\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def logarithmic(n):\n      while n > 1:\n        n = n / 5\n        print(n)\n    \n\n    1def logarithmic(n):\n    2  while n > 1:\n    3    n = n / 5\n    4    print(n)\n    5\n\nNote we use the word \"division\" and not \"half\", because you don't need to divide by two in order to get logarithmic functions. In fact, the larger the divisor, the faster the logarithmic operation is. In the example above, we don't halve the input, we divide it by 5.\n\nSo in binary search, we can see that we are repeatedly dividing the array in half and exploring smaller and smaller sections of it. This gives us a logarithmic runtime for binary search.\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def binary_search(nums, target):\n      left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n      while left <= right:\n          mid = left + (right - left) // 2 # ← repeated division in a loop!\n          if nums[mid] == target:\n              return mid\n          elif nums[mid] < target:\n              left = mid + 1\n          else:\n              right = mid - 1\n      return -1\n    \n    \n\n    1def binary_search(nums, target):\n    2  left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    3  while left <= right:\n    4      mid = left + (right - left) // 2 # ← repeated division in a loop!\n    5      if nums[mid] == target:\n    6          return mid\n    7      elif nums[mid] < target:\n    8          left = mid + 1\n    9      else:\n    10          right = mid - 1\n    11  return -1\n    12\n    13\n\nCompanies That Ask Binary Search Questions\n------------------------------------------\n\n[![Google](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgoogle_com_128x128_2818837343.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Google](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Watch 40  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=google)\n\n[![Amazon](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Famazon_128x128_15213fbc98.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Watch 31  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=amazon)\n\nWhen to Use Binary Search in Interviews\n---------------------------------------\n\nBinary search is a vital tool for software engineering interviews, especially when dealing with problems involving sorted arrays or lists. The scenario of using binary search can be broken down into several categories – let's start with the usual ones before moving to the advanced uses:\n\n*   **Searching an element in a sorted array or list**: This is the most direct use case for binary search. If the problem involves finding an element in a sorted list or array, binary search should be your first instinct. Usually you won't get a question as direct as \"given a sorted array, find if X is in the array.\" However, you will often need to find Note the word \"sorted\" here. Binary search will not work if the input isn't sorted, since the sorting determines the direction we can choose to move.\n*   **Rotated Arrays**: Problems involving rotated sorted arrays often lend themselves to solutions using binary search, for example finding a target value in a rotated array.\n*   **Finding boundaries**: Binary search can be used to find the first or last occurrence of a value in a sorted array, or to determine the lower or upper bound of a range.\n*   **Optimization problems**: Some optimization problems can be solved using binary search, especially those which require finding a specific threshold or breakpoint within a given range.\n\nThree Sum Example\n-----------------\n\nLet's discuss binary search in the context of a specific problem: [Three Sum](https://interviewing.io/questions/three-sum)\n.\n\nThis problem is presented as the following:\n\n    Find a unique triplet in an array that sums up to 0.\n    \n    An example input and output could look like this:\n    Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]\n    Output: [-1,-1,2] or [-1, 0, 1]\n    \n\nWhile it is not the most optimal solution to solve the 3Sum problem, this problem can be solved with a binary search. At first glance, it might not be immediately clear how binary search fits into this problem though! The immediate solution most people consider is a brute force and involves three nested loops trying every possible combination of 3 numbers until one results in a valid solution. However, binary search can be incredibly useful when you want to reduce the search space and increase the speed of your algorithm. The brute force is cubic `O(N^3)` because of the three nested loops.\n\nAfter some thought, we might realize that the 3rd loop is just a linear search for a specific number. If the goal is for the three numbers to sum to zero and the first two numbers from the first two loops are -3 and -2 then we are using the 3rd and final loop to look specifically for the number 5 in the array. This is known as finding the **complement** of the first two numbers.\n\nHere's the general approach for the 3Sum problem using binary search:\n\n1.  **Sort the array**: This is the initial step which will facilitate the use of binary search and ensure the output triplets are not duplicates. Sorting the array will have a time complexity of `O(n log n)`.\n2.  **Iterate over the array:** For each index 'i' of the array, we'll try to find two other indices 'j' and 'k', such that the sum of the values at these indices equals zero. 'j' starts as the next index after 'i', and 'k' starts as the last index of the array.\n3.  **Binary Search**: For each 'i' and 'j', we calculate the required value to reach the target as `(0 - nums[i] - nums[j])`. Now, we perform binary search on the array to find this value.\n\nThe sorting operation gives us a time complexity of `O(n log n)`, the two nested loops contribute a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, and within the innermost loop, we perform a binary search contributing a time complexity of `O(log n)`. Thus, the overall time complexity for this solution is `O(n^2 log n)`. Although this isn't the most efficient solution for the 3Sum problem (there's an `O(n^2)` solution using two pointers), it demonstrates how binary search can be applied in scenarios where it may not be immediately obvious to do so.\n\nAdvanced Binary Search\n----------------------\n\n### Binary Search on 2D Matrices\n\nAfter you understand Binary Search on a one-dimensional array, you can explore multi-dimensional array binary search. This is a favorite type of question that [Google](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google#google)\n asks. The most common multidimensional array binary search is a 2D matrix search, but there do exist three and even four dimensional search questions.\n\n**Real Problem Example**: [Search a 2D Matrix](https://interviewing.io/binary-search-interview-questions)\n\n### Binary Search on a Continuous Search Space\n\nThis version of binary search is used in problems where the “search space” is continuous rather than discrete. This can be useful for certain optimization problems. By continuous we mean the solutions could take on any value within a certain range, not just certain specific values. The range between 0 and 1, for instance, is infinite so finding an exact decimal in an infinite search space is tricky.\n\nThis can also apply in multidimensional continuous spaces. For example, if we are trying to find the minimum value of a continuous function, we might use a variant of binary search known as the \"binary search on two points,\" where we divide our current range into three subranges and eliminate the subrange that has the highest function value.\n\nOverall, binary search in continuous spaces can be a powerful tool for finding solutions to problems that involve continuous ranges or functions.\n\n**Real Problem Example**: [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)\n\n### Binary Search with Doubling\n\nThis is a variant of binary search where the bounds of the search are not known in advance. An initial range is established by repeatedly doubling the upper bound until it is beyond the target, then binary search is applied within the determined bounds. The key idea is to start with a small subarray size and to exponentially expand the subarray size until the subarray end exceeds the target value or the end of the full array.\n\nExponential search can be particularly efficient when searching for an item near the beginning of the array. If the target element is near the start, the algorithm will find it in `O(log i)` time where `i` is the position of the target.\n\n**Real Problem Example**: [Search in a Sorted Array of Unknown Size](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/)\n\nSpot the Bug!\n-------------\n\nNow you might feel empowered with knowledge and new-found appreciation for the wide range of uses with binary search, but unfortunately with these problems, the biggest issue tends to be in the implementation. It is _really_ hard to tell just by looking at your code if it is correct or not. Let's illustrate with an example – give yourself a minute and see if you can spot the error in the binary search code below!\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def binarySearch(arr, target):\n      l , r = 0, len(arr) \n      while l < r:            \n        mid = (l + r) / 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n          return mid\n        if target > arr[mid]:\n          l = mid\n        else:\n          r = mid\n      return -1\n\n    1def binarySearch(arr, target):\n    2  l , r = 0, len(arr) \n    3  while l < r:            \n    4    mid = (l + r) / 2\n    5    if arr[mid] == target:\n    6      return mid\n    7    if target > arr[mid]:\n    8      l = mid\n    9    else:\n    10      r = mid\n    11  return -1\n\nOk, did you spot the error? Trick question – depending on the language you're using and the way we count them there are actually anywhere between 4-6 errors in the above code! 🤯 Hopefully this illustrates the point that they are easy to miss! Let's walk through these errors together, one at a time.\n\n### Error 1: Right Index\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def binarySearch(arr, target):\n      l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1  # <- FIXED!\n      while l < r:            \n        mid = (l + r) / 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n          return mid\n        if target > arr[mid]:\n          l = mid\n        else:\n          r = mid\n      return -1\n\n    1def binarySearch(arr, target):\n    2  l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1  # <- FIXED!\n    3  while l < r:            \n    4    mid = (l + r) / 2\n    5    if arr[mid] == target:\n    6      return mid\n    7    if target > arr[mid]:\n    8      l = mid\n    9    else:\n    10      r = mid\n    11  return -1\n\n### Error 2: Conditional\n\nConsider the edge case where we have a single element in the array which _is the target that we are looking for_.\n\n    arr = [5]\n    target = 5\n    \n    l = 0\n    r = 0\n    \n\nIn this test case, you'll see that both the left and right pointers end up being 0 and we skip the `while` loop conditional, never going inside it, and just return -1! That's wrong! Let's fix that by making the conditional `<=` rather than just `<`.\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def binarySearch(arr, target):\n      l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1\n      while l <= r: # <- FIXED!\n        mid = (l + r) / 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n          return mid\n        if target > arr[mid]:\n          l = mid\n        else:\n          r = mid\n      return -1\n\n    1def binarySearch(arr, target):\n    2  l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    3  while l <= r: # <- FIXED!\n    4    mid = (l + r) / 2\n    5    if arr[mid] == target:\n    6      return mid\n    7    if target > arr[mid]:\n    8      l = mid\n    9    else:\n    10      r = mid\n    11  return -1\n\n### Error 3: Middle Index Calculation\n\nThe calculation of the middle index is incorrect. We need to find the center between the left and right pointers, but as it currently is coded we end up with a decimal number not a whole number. Since we are using this value to index into arrays, we need a whole number (there is no meaning in trying to access index 3.2 in an array, only whole indices like 3 and 4). So we need to make sure to either consistently round up or down – we recommend rounding down.\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def binarySearch(arr, target):\n      l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1\n      while l <= r:            \n        mid = (l + r) // 2 # <- FIXED!\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n          return mid\n        if target > arr[mid]:\n          l = mid\n        else:\n          r = mid\n      return -1\n\n    1def binarySearch(arr, target):\n    2  l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    3  while l <= r:            \n    4    mid = (l + r) // 2 # <- FIXED!\n    5    if arr[mid] == target:\n    6      return mid\n    7    if target > arr[mid]:\n    8      l = mid\n    9    else:\n    10      r = mid\n    11  return -1\n\n### Error 4: Middle Index Calculation Again\n\nAdmittedly, this next error is a bit niche, and only applies to statically typed languages like Java & C++, but it is worth knowing as a developer for historical reasons. Even after rounding down in our previous rendition this still could result in an error.\n\nWhenever we add two large numbers together in a statically typed language we risk potentially causing an integer overflow. Since statically typed languages allocate a specific amount of memory and no more, if you try to store a number that is too large in pre-allocated memory and you don't have enough room to store it all the value will \"overflow.\"\n\nThis error is not binary search specific, but for historical reasons it is well known for needing to be avoided in Binary Search specifically. This is due to an [infamous bug in the Java library's implementation of binary search back in 2006](https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html)\n.\n\nTo fix it, we can avoid adding two large numbers together by using a slightly different formula that accomplishes the same thing. Notice how we first make the number significantly smaller through subtraction and division before adding?\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def binarySearch(arr, target):\n      l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1\n      while l <= r:            \n        mid = l + ((r - l) // 2) # <- not a problem, in python, but still a better formula\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n          return mid\n        if target > arr[mid]:\n          l = mid\n        else:\n          r = mid\n      return -1\n    \n\n    1def binarySearch(arr, target):\n    2  l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    3  while l <= r:            \n    4    mid = l + ((r - l) // 2) # <- not a problem, in python, but still a better formula\n    5    if arr[mid] == target:\n    6      return mid\n    7    if target > arr[mid]:\n    8      l = mid\n    9    else:\n    10      r = mid\n    11  return -1\n    12\n\n### Error 5 & 6: Infinite Loop\n\nConsider the edge case where we have a single element in the array (again) but it is not the target. We will enter the second if-statement, but we set the left pointer to the middle pointer and the middle pointer is 0.\n\n    arr = [2]\n    target = 5\n    \n    l = 0\n    r = 0\n    m = 0\n    \n\nIn this test case, all three pointers now are 0 and since our conditional checks if l <= r this will always be the case and we will loop infinitely. 😩\n\nWe don't really want to change the loop conditional because we already changed it in Error 2, to avoid a different problem so instead we can set the left and right pointers to a number less than or greater than the middle (depending on the direction).\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def binarySearch(arr, target):\n      l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1\n      while l <= r:            \n        mid = l + ((r - l) // 2)\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n          return mid\n        if target > arr[mid]:\n          l = mid + 1 # <- FIXED!\n        else:\n          r = mid - 1 # <- FIXED!\n      return -1\n\n    1def binarySearch(arr, target):\n    2  l , r = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    3  while l <= r:            \n    4    mid = l + ((r - l) // 2)\n    5    if arr[mid] == target:\n    6      return mid\n    7    if target > arr[mid]:\n    8      l = mid + 1 # <- FIXED!\n    9    else:\n    10      r = mid - 1 # <- FIXED!\n    11  return -1\n\nFinally! A working binary search! This painful walkthrough hopefully helps illustrate a key point – binary search is extremely difficult to get right just by doing it in your head and staring at the code. Since binary search is prone to so many problems the level of scrutiny your code will be given is higher than for other problems. Be sure your binary search works!\n\nCommon Mistakes in Interviews Featuring Binary Search\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Missing a Test Case\n\nIt is so easy to mess up binary search by missing a test case. This usually leads to an out-of-bounds error. This is the most common mistake in binary search questions, so take your time and test that the code works. The most common test cases that get missed are:\n\n*   **Empty Array**: An empty array is a basic edge case. Your function should handle this gracefully and return an appropriate value, such as -1 for a function expected to return an index, or False for a function determining the presence of an element.\n*   **Single Element Array**: This is the smallest non-empty array. Make sure your function can handle this, whether the single element matches the target or not.\n*   **Array with Two Elements**: This scenario tests if your function correctly moves the left or right pointer when there are just two elements. Both cases, where the target is and is not in the array, should be considered.\n*   **Array with Duplicates**: Duplicates can complicate a binary search, especially if you are supposed to find the first or last occurrence of the target. Test your function with an array that has duplicate values.\n*   **Target is the First or Last Element**: This tests whether your function correctly handles cases where the target is at the boundaries of the array.\n*   **Target is the Middle Element**: This tests where you calculate the middle element in your algorithm to make sure you don't skip it on the first iteration.\n*   **Target is Not in the Array**: Check how your function behaves when the target is not in the array. This could include targets that are smaller than all array elements, larger than all array elements, or fall between array elements.\n*   **Array with Negative Numbers**: If the problem statement doesn't restrict the array values to be positive, test your function with negative numbers to ensure it handles them correctly.\n*   **Array with All Identical Elements**: This tests whether your function can correctly report the position of an element when all elements in the array are identical, and also if it correctly reports that a target is not found when the target differs from the repeated element.\n*   **Array is Even/Odd:** This ensures you land on the target and correctly calculate the midpoint regardless of even or odd array sizes.\n*   **Large Arrays**: Test your function with a large array to ensure that it performs well and does not lead to any issues, such as stack overflow for recursive implementations.\n\nHoly smokes, that's a lot of tests! At interviewing.io we have found that even after interviewees know they might be missing a test case, they aren't sure which one it is and definitely don't have time to go down such an exhaustive checklist like this, so we've come up with an easy to remember acronym that will help you cover your bases. **Just ask yourself, \"Is my solution FINDABLE?\"** This reminds you to check these key edge cases to ensure your binary search solution is robust.\n\n*   **F**irst/**F**inal: The target is the first element or last (final) element in the array.\n*   **I**dentical: The array contains multiple identical targets.\n*   **N**on-existent: The target is not in the array.\n*   **D**elete: The array contains only duplicate elements.\n*   **A**lone: The array has a single element.\n*   **B**inary: The array has two elements.\n*   **L**arge: The array is quite large.\n*   **E**mpty: The array is empty.\n\nWe don't explicitly call out every test case in this acronym, but when it is combined with the testing process shown below you end up covering tests that are not explicitly mentioned (i.e. we don't have a letter in the acronym that calls out testing even/odd elements or that we successfully return the middle element on the first iteration, but in following the below process we do end up testing these cases in tandem with other test cases).\n\nAt a glance this may seem like a lot of tests to run through, but we can make the process very fast by building up our tests in a specific order. Some tests may also not apply in a problem so they are also easy to skip over entirely. The ideal order to check your solution would be to build up from an empty array and work towards a large (well, large for a test by-hand case) number of four total elements like below:\n\n![This is the optimal ordering for testing a binary search.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/binary_search_optimal_testing_ba41a2876a.jpg)\n\nThis order allows us to double up testing multiple things at the same time. We can test two elements in the array while testing the final element boundary. We test identical elements (duplicates) while testing for the target being in the middle and testing a non-trivial odd number of elements. And we can test a large four-element array while testing an even number of elements.\n\nThe first four test cases should be able to be breezed through in 30 seconds or less with the remaining four taking slightly longer than that. While this isn't an exhaustive set of test cases, they are the ones most likely to catch bugs, so you can spend less than 2 minutes on this process in total and still feel very confident that your answer is correct.\n\n### Forgetting Sorting Adds to the Time Complexity\n\nMost candidates are familiar with the fact that standard comparison-based sorting takes `O(N log N)` time complexity, but forget to account for it in their solution. In the Three Sum question above, sorting the array takes just one line in the solution and candidates end up missing it in their overall time complexity analysis because it is so easy to skip over.\n\n### Logically Deduce Binary Search with Big-O\n\nAn advanced strategy for discovering the optimal solution to a problem is to discuss the time complexity with the interviewer. If you suggest a linear solution to a problem and try to confirm if it is optimal with the interviewer, you might get pushback on it or be told that \"it's decent for now, maybe we can optimize later.\" This is actually a large hint towards binary search.\n\nWalking through the time complexities, if we are told we can optimize a linear time algorithm, this points directly to a logarithmic algorithm and binary search is the most common algorithm with this time complexity. Being able to logically deduce binary search given the constraints of the problem shows mastery over the topic.\n\n### Discuss Edge Cases Proactively\n\nAbove we outline many edge cases for binary search. While you could go through them all in your head, you demonstrate mastery by _communicating_ these edge cases. Checking these test cases quietly will bore your interviewer, but explaining the many test cases you are doing simultaneously shows mastery in the interview.\n\nBinary Search Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHere are some commonly asked questions about binary search that you might encounter or want to consider:\n\n### Should I Use Recursive or Iterative Binary Search?\n\nUsually when we have the \"recursive versus iterative\" debate with an algorithm it is with [DFS](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n and [BFS](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions#what-is-breadth-first-search-bfs)\n. For these algorithms it mostly doesn't matter which one you pick because you don't save any space by solving the problem iteratively versus recursively. In an iterative DFS you need to explicitly create a [Stack](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n just as you explicitly create a [Queue](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n in BFS. Recursive DFS uses the built in call stack, so you still end up using space for the stack.\n\nIn binary search, you don't need a stack so using recursion (and the implicit call stack) uses more space than the iterative approach. With that said, the difference between space complexities is`O(1)` vs `O(log N)`. It's a small amount of space, so it doesn't really matter much from this perspective. Here at interviewing.io we prefer the iterative approach less because of the space savings and more because it is easier to walk through the plethora of test cases and not get lost. At the end of the day, pick what works best for you!\n\n### Why Is Binary Search Preferred Over Linear Search?\n\nHopefully this isn't a question you still have at this point! Binary search is preferred because of its time efficiency. It has a time complexity of `O(log n)` which makes it significantly faster than linear search (`O(n)`) on large datasets.\n\n### How Do You Handle Duplicates in Binary Search?\n\nThis depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If the problem is simply to find if an element exists, then any occurrence can be returned. If the problem specifies finding the first or last occurrence, then the binary search algorithm can be slightly modified to handle these cases.\n\n### Can I Use Binary Search on a Linked List?\n\nTechnically, yes, but it's not efficient. Binary search requires random access to elements, which is not possible with linked lists. Hence, using binary search on a linked list would still require `O(n)` time to access elements (specifically the \"right pointer\"), negating the benefits of using binary search in the first place.\n\nCommon Binary Search interview Questions\n----------------------------------------\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Recover Binary Search Tree](https://interviewing.io/questions/recover-binary-search-tree)\n\n[Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

          "content": "### Why They Matter\n\nScared of logarithms? If you like most people, you probably haven't worked with logarithms for a very long time if you ever even did it in the first place!That's okay! All you really need to know is a small number of facts to be comfortable talking about them in interviews.\n\n*   Logarithms are expressed in this format: $log\\_b(n) = x$, where b is the base number, n is the number you want to transform, and x is the result. It says b raised to the power x equals n.\n*   In computer science, we pretty safely ignore the \"b\" (base) since it is likely to always be base 10 that we are working with. So instead of saying log\\_10(N), we just say log (N).\n*   The last and most important thing to know is that logs are an infinitesimally small number compared to the number you're taking the log of. For instance, take the number 1 trillion. That's a huge number, but log (1 trillion) is just 12!\n\nThe reason this is worth discussing is because many candidates don't appreciate the difference between time complexities involving logs. You've probably seen an example of time complexities plotted on a graph before, something like this:\n\n![Time Complexity Chart with Logs](https://everythingcomputerscience.com/images/Algorithm_Analysis731x524.jpg)\n\nThe graph illustrates three time complexities: `O(log N)`, `O(N)`, and `O(N log N)`. The difference in scale between `O(log N)` and `O(N)` is massive, not slight, as input sizes increase. This means if you can use a logarithmic algorithm it isn't \"slightly better than linear\" it is massively better. The operations needed for a logarithmic algorithm are infinitesimal compared to a linear algorithm.\n\n`O(N log N)` represents log-linear time complexity. Candidates occasionally find it difficult to remember where it falls on the spectrum of complexities, but it helps to remember the implicit multiplication in the notation. It isn't `O(N log N)` it is `O(N * log N)`. Thus, `O(N log N)` is larger than `O(N)` since we are multiplying it by something, yet it is still relatively small, as it's multiplied by the significantly smaller `O(log N)`.",

          "content": "### Why Is Binary Search Logarithmic? _Repeatedly_ dividing something creates a logarithmic function (note the emphasis on the word **repeated** here). If you divide something once, it does not change the asymptotic nature of the function. This code below would still be considered linear, _not_ logarithmic: PythonJavaC++ def linear(n): for i in range(n/2): print(i) 1def linear(n): 2 for i in range(n/2): 3 print(i) 4 But if we are repeatedly dividing something, we are doing something inherently logarithmic with it. See the below code as an example: PythonJavaC++ def logarithmic(n): while n > 1: n = n / 5 print(n) 1def logarithmic(n): 2 while n > 1: 3 n = n / 5 4 print(n) 5 Note we use the word \"division\" and not \"half\", because you don't need to divide by two in order to get logarithmic functions. In fact, the larger the divisor, the faster the logarithmic operation is. In the example above, we don't halve the input, we divide it by 5. So in binary search, we can see that we are repeatedly dividing the array in half and exploring smaller and smaller sections of it. This gives us a logarithmic runtime for binary search. PythonJavaC++ def binary_search(nums, target): left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1 while left <= right: mid = left + (right - left) // 2 # ← repeated division in a loop! if nums[mid] == target: return mid elif nums[mid] < target: left = mid + 1 else: right = mid - 1 return -1 1def binary_search(nums, target): 2 left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1 3 while left <= right: 4 mid = left + (right - left) // 2 # ← repeated division in a loop! 5 if nums[mid] == target: 6 return mid 7 elif nums[mid] < target: 8 left = mid + 1 9 else: 10 right = mid - 1 11 return -1 12 13 Companies That Ask Binary Search Questions ------------------------------------------ [![Google](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgoogle_com_128x128_2818837343.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google) [Google](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google) [Interview process \\ & questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google) [Watch 40 \\ interview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=google) [![Amazon](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Famazon_128x128_15213fbc98.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon) [Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon) [Interview process \\ & questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon) [Watch 31 \\ interview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=amazon) When to Use Binary Search in Interviews --------------------------------------- Binary search is a vital tool for software engineering interviews, especially when dealing with problems involving sorted arrays or lists. The scenario of using binary search can be broken down into several categories – let's start with the usual ones before moving to the advanced uses: * **Searching an element in a sorted array or list**: This is the most direct use case for binary search. If the problem involves finding an element in a sorted list or array, binary search should be your first instinct. Usually you won't get a question as direct as \"given a sorted array, find if X is in the array.\" However, you will often need to find Note the word \"sorted\" here. Binary search will not work if the input isn't sorted, since the sorting determines the direction we can choose to move. * **Rotated Arrays**: Problems involving rotated sorted arrays often lend themselves to solutions using binary search, for example finding a target value in a rotated array. * **Finding boundaries**: Binary search can be used to find the first or last occurrence of a value in a sorted array, or to determine the lower or upper bound of a range. * **Optimization problems**: Some optimization problems can be solved using binary search, especially those which require finding a specific threshold or breakpoint within a given range. Three Sum Example ----------------- Let's discuss binary search in the context of a specific problem: [Three Sum](https://interviewing.io/questions/three-sum) . This problem is presented as the following: Find a unique triplet in an array that sums up to 0. An example input and output could look like this: Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4] Output: [-1,-1,2] or [-1, 0, 1] While it is not the most optimal solution to solve the 3Sum problem, this problem can be solved with a binary search. At first glance, it might not be immediately clear how binary search fits into this problem though! The immediate solution most people consider is a brute force and involves three nested loops trying every possible combination of 3 numbers until one results in a valid solution. However, binary search can be incredibly useful when you want to reduce the search space and increase the speed of your algorithm. The brute force is cubic `O(N^3)` because of the three nested loops. After some thought, we might realize that the 3rd loop is just a linear search for a specific number. If the goal is for the three numbers to sum to zero and the first two numbers from the first two loops are -3 and -2 then we are using the 3rd and final loop to look specifically for the number 5 in the array. This is known as finding the **complement** of the first two numbers. Here's the general approach for the 3Sum problem using binary search: 1. **Sort the array**: This is the initial step which will facilitate the use of binary search and ensure the output triplets are not duplicates. Sorting the array will have a time complexity of `O(n log n)`. 2. **Iterate over the array:** For each index 'i' of the array, we'll try to find two other indices 'j' and 'k', such that the sum of the values at these indices equals zero. 'j' starts as the next index after 'i', and 'k' starts as the last index of the array. 3. **Binary Search**: For each 'i' and 'j', we calculate the required value to reach the target as `(0 - nums[i] - nums[j])`. Now, we perform binary search on the array to find this value. The sorting operation gives us a time complexity of `O(n log n)`, the two nested loops contribute a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, and within the innermost loop, we perform a binary search contributing a time complexity of `O(log n)`. Thus, the overall time complexity for this solution is `O(n^2 log n)`.",

Although this isn't the most efficient solution for the 3Sum problem (there's an `O(n^2)` solution using two pointers), it demonstrates how binary search can be applied in scenarios where it may not be immediately obvious to do so.

This can be useful for certain optimization problems. By continuous we mean the solutions could take on any value within a certain range, not just certain specific values. The range between 0 and 1, for instance, is infinite so finding an exact decimal in an infinite search space is tricky.\n\nThis can also apply in multidimensional continuous spaces. For example, if we are trying to find the minimum value of a continuous function, we might use a variant of binary search known as the \"binary search on two points,\" where we divide our current range into three subranges and eliminate the subrange that has the highest function value.\n\nOverall, binary search in continuous spaces can be a powerful tool for finding solutions to problems that involve continuous ranges or functions.\n\n**Real Problem Example**: [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)",

          "content": "### Binary Search with Doubling\n\nThis is a variant of binary search where the bounds of the search are not known in advance. An initial range is established by repeatedly doubling the upper bound until it is beyond the target, then binary search is applied within the determined bounds. The key idea is to start with a small subarray size and to exponentially expand the subarray size until the subarray end exceeds the target value or the end of the full array.\n\nExponential search can be particularly efficient when searching for an item near the beginning of the array. If the target element is near the start, the algorithm will find it in `O(log i)` time where `i` is the position of the target.\n\n**Real Problem Example**: [Search in a Sorted Array of Unknown Size](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/)\n\nSpot the Bug!\n-------------\n\nNow you might feel empowered with knowledge and new-found appreciation for the wide range of uses with binary search, but unfortunately with these problems, the biggest issue tends to be in the implementation. It is _really_ hard to tell just by looking at your code if it is correct or not. Let's illustrate with an example – give yourself a minute and see if you can spot the error in the binary search code below!\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    def binarySearch(arr, target):\n      l , r = 0, len(arr) \n      while l < r:            \n        mid = (l + r) / 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n          return mid\n        if target > arr[mid]:\n          l = mid\n        else:\n          r = mid\n      return -1\n\n    1def binarySearch(arr, target):\n    2  l , r = 0, len(arr) \n    3  while l < r:            \n    4    mid = (l + r) / 2\n    5    if arr[mid] == target:\n    6      return mid\n    7    if target > arr[mid]:\n    8      l = mid\n    9    else:\n    10      r = mid\n    11  return -1\n\nOk, did you spot the error? Trick question – depending on the language you're using and the way we count them there are actually anywhere between 4-6 errors in the above code! 🤯 Hopefully this illustrates the point that they are easy to miss!

          "content": "### Missing a Test Case\n\nIt is so easy to mess up binary search by missing a test case. This usually leads to an out-of-bounds error. This is the most common mistake in binary search questions, so take your time and test that the code works. The most common test cases that get missed are:\n\n*   **Empty Array**: An empty array is a basic edge case. Your function should handle this gracefully and return an appropriate value, such as -1 for a function expected to return an index, or False for a function determining the presence of an element.\n*   **Single Element Array**: This is the smallest non-empty array. Make sure your function can handle this, whether the single element matches the target or not.\n*   **Array with Two Elements**: This scenario tests if your function correctly moves the left or right pointer when there are just two elements. Both cases, where the target is and is not in the array, should be considered.\n*   **Array with Duplicates**: Duplicates can complicate a binary search, especially if you are supposed to find the first or last occurrence of the target. Test your function with an array that has duplicate values.\n*   **Target is the First or Last Element**: This tests whether your function correctly handles cases where the target is at the boundaries of the array.\n*   **Target is the Middle Element**: This tests where you calculate the middle element in your algorithm to make sure you don't skip it on the first iteration.\n*   **Target is Not in the Array**: Check how your function behaves when the target is not in the array. This could include targets that are smaller than all array elements, larger than all array elements, or fall between array elements.\n*   **Array with Negative Numbers**: If the problem statement doesn't restrict the array values to be positive, test your function with negative numbers to ensure it handles them correctly.\n*   **Array with All Identical Elements**: This tests whether your function can correctly report the position of an element when all elements in the array are identical, and also if it correctly reports that a target is not found when the target differs from the repeated element.\n*   **Array is Even/Odd:** This ensures you land on the target and correctly calculate the midpoint regardless of even or odd array sizes.\n*   **Large Arrays**: Test your function with a large array to ensure that it performs well and does not lead to any issues, such as stack overflow for recursive implementations.\n\nHoly smokes, that's a lot of tests! At interviewing.io we have found that even after interviewees know they might be missing a test case, they aren't sure which one it is and definitely don't have time to go down such an exhaustive checklist like this, so we've come up with an easy to remember acronym that will help you cover your bases. **Just ask yourself, \"Is my solution FINDABLE?\"** This reminds you to check these key edge cases to ensure your binary search solution is robust.\n\n*   **F**irst/**F**inal: The target is the first element or last (final) element in the array.\n*   **I**dentical: The array contains multiple identical targets.\n*   **N**on-existent: The target is not in the array.\n*   **D**elete: The array contains only duplicate elements.\n*   **A**lone: The array has a single element.\n*   **B**inary: The array has two elements.\n*   **L**arge: The array is quite large.\n*   **E**mpty: The array is empty.\n\nWe don't explicitly call out every test case in this acronym, but when it is combined with the testing process shown below you end up covering tests that are not explicitly mentioned (i.e. we don't have a letter in the acronym that calls out testing even/odd elements or that we successfully return the middle element on the first iteration, but in following the below process we do end up testing these cases in tandem with other test cases).\n\nAt a glance this may seem like a lot of tests to run through, but we can make the process very fast by building up our tests in a specific order. Some tests may also not apply in a problem so they are also easy to skip over entirely. The ideal order to check your solution would be to build up from an empty array and work towards a large (well, large for a test by-hand case) number of four total elements like below:\n\n![This is the optimal ordering for testing a binary search.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/binary_search_optimal_testing_ba41a2876a.jpg)\n\nThis order allows us to double up testing multiple things at the same time. We can test two elements in the array while testing the final element boundary. We test identical elements (duplicates) while testing for the target being in the middle and testing a non-trivial odd number of elements. And we can test a large four-element array while testing an even number of elements.\n\nThe first four test cases should be able to be breezed through in 30 seconds or less with the remaining four taking slightly longer than that. While this isn't an exhaustive set of test cases, they are the ones most likely to catch bugs, so you can spend less than 2 minutes on this process in total and still feel very confident that your answer is correct.",

For these algorithms it mostly doesn't matter which one you pick because you don't save any space by solving the problem iteratively versus recursively. In an iterative DFS you need to explicitly create a [Stack](https://interviewing.io/stacks-interview-questions)\n just as you explicitly create a [Queue](https://interviewing.io/queue-interview-questions)\n in BFS. Recursive DFS uses the built in call stack, so you still end up using space for the stack.\n\nIn binary search, you don't need a stack so using recursion (and the implicit call stack) uses more space than the iterative approach. With that said, the difference between space complexities is`O(1)` vs `O(log N)`. It's a small amount of space, so it doesn't really matter much from this perspective. Here at interviewing.io we prefer the iterative approach less because of the space savings and more because it is easier to walk through the plethora of test cases and not get lost.

This binary structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, especially when further rules are applied to the tree to express different types of binary trees.\n\n![simple binary tree consisting of five nodes.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image3_2947582935.png)\n\nHere's an example of a binary tree node implementation:\n\nJava\n\n    class BinaryTreeNode {\n        Integer data = null;\n        BinaryTreeNode left = null;\n        BinaryTreeNode right = null;\n    \n        BinaryTreeNode(Integer value) {\n            data = value;\n        }\n    }\n\n    1class BinaryTreeNode {\n    2    Integer data = null;\n    3    BinaryTreeNode left = null;\n    4    BinaryTreeNode right = null;\n    5\n    6    BinaryTreeNode(Integer value) {\n    7        data = value;\n    8    }\n    9}\n\nGiven that not all nodes need to have two children, binary trees can be tall or wide, and everything in between. If each node in a binary tree only has one child (except for leaves), the tree would be much taller than it is wide. On the other hand, if most or all the nodes in a binary tree have two children, then the tree would be considered balanced.\n\nSpecifically, we can view binary trees as being balanced or unbalanced by this measure: a binary tree is balanced when the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one. \\*\\*The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf. \\*\\*\n\n![comparison of an unbalanced tree and its balanced variation.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image8_8ca293ee68.png)\n\nThe main advantage of a balanced binary tree is that we can achieve optimal performance for searching, adding and deleting operations - by maintaining logarithmic height, these operations can be performed in O(log n) time complexity on average.\n\nExamples of balanced binary trees are **AVL trees** and **Red-Black trees**. These are considered advanced topics, sometimes found in database implementations along with other use-cases, and rarely come up in interview questions. More often, when discussing binary tree optimizations, we encounter binary search trees.\n\nWhat is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?\n-----------------------------------\n\nA common implementation of a binary tree is a **binary search tree**. Right there in the name, the binary search tree enables efficient implementation of the binary search algorithm thanks to the way the binary tree is organized: for each node in the tree, the value of the node is greater than the value of all the nodes in its left subtree and smaller than the value of all the nodes in its right subtree.\n\n![a simple binary search tree consisting of nine nodes, with a height of four.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image2_43e1c4c5b9.png)\n\nDue to the tree's binary search property, this structure enables a systematic and efficient search process. When searching for a target value, comparisons are made at each node to determine whether to process the left or the right subtree. This allows for the elimination of half of the remaining search space at each step, resulting in a worst-case time complexity of O(log n) for searching, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nThe height of a binary search tree affects the efficiency of the operations. Balanced binary search trees, such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees, maintain a balanced structure to ensure logarithmic time complexity for operations.\n\n### Implementing a Binary Search Tree\n\nTo create a binary search tree, the insertNode method will enforce the binary search property. Traversing from the root, insertNode will recursively search for the correct position to add the new node by checking the binary condition: if the currentNode is larger than the new node, traverse left, if the currentNode is smaller than the new node, traverse right. Search will apply the same logic, but return if the target is found.\n\n#### Insert\n\nJava\n\n    private BinaryTreeNode insertNode(BinaryTreeNode root, int key) {\n            if (root == null) {\n                return new BinaryTreeNode(key);\n            }\n    \n            if (key < root.data) {\n                root.left = insertNode(root.left, key);\n            } else if (key > root.data) {\n                root.right = insertNode(root.right, key);\n            }\n            \n            // if the input key already exists, we don't do anything.\n            return currentNode;\n        }\n\n    1private BinaryTreeNode insertNode(BinaryTreeNode root, int key) {\n    2        if (root == null) {\n    3            return new BinaryTreeNode(key);\n    4        }\n    5\n    6        if (key < root.data) {\n    7            root.left = insertNode(root.left, key);\n    8        } else if (key > root.data) {\n    9            root.right = insertNode(root.right, key);\n    10        }\n    11        \n    12        // if the input key already exists, we don't do anything.\n    13        return currentNode;\n    14    }\n\n#### Delete\n\njava\n\n    private BinaryTreeNode deleteNode(BinaryTreeNode root, Integer key) {\n            if (root == null) {\n                return root;\n            }\n            \n            if (key < root.data) {\n                root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);\n            } else if (data > root.data) {\n                root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);\n            } else {\n                // Node to be deleted is found\n                \n                // Case 1: Node has no child or only one child\n                if (root.left == null) {\n                    return root.right;\n                } else if (root.right == null) {\n                    return root.left;\n                }\n                \n                // Case 2: Node has two children\n                root.data = minValue(root.right);\n                root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.data);\n            }\n            \n            return root;\n        }\n    \n    private Integer minValue(BinaryTreeNode root) {\n            Integer minValue = root.data;\n            while (root.left != null) {\n                 minValue = root.left.data;\n                 root = root.left\n            }\n            return minValue;\n    }\n\n    1private BinaryTreeNode deleteNode(BinaryTreeNode root, Integer key) {\n    2        if (root == null) {\n    3            return root;\n    4        }\n    5        \n    6        if (key < root.data) {\n    7            root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);\n    8        } else if (data > root.data) {\n    9            root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);\n    10        } else {\n    11            // Node to be deleted is found\n    12            \n    13            // Case 1: Node has no child or only one child\n    14            if (root.left == null) {\n    15                return root.right;\n    16            } else if (root.right == null) {\n    17                return root.left;\n    18            }\n    19            \n    20            // Case 2: Node has two children\n    21            root.data = minValue(root.right);\n    22            root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.data);\n    23        }\n    24        \n    25        return root;\n    26    }\n    27\n    28private Integer minValue(BinaryTreeNode root) {\n    29        Integer minValue = root.data;\n    30        while (root.left != null) {\n    31             minValue = root.left.data;\n    32             root = root.left\n    33        }\n    34        return minValue;\n    35}\n\nCompanies That Ask Binary Tree Questions\n----------------------------------------\n\nTraversal Order in a Binary Tree\n--------------------------------\n\nA common task with binary trees is traversing the data structure, since without random access, this is the only way to do anything with our data: search, add, delete, print, etc. In addition to selecting an appropriate traversal algorithm, we also need to determine the order in which we want to visit the nodes.\n\nAt a high level, there are two types of traversals: depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). To explore these algorithms generally, you should read more about [DFS](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n and [BFS](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n. But in this article, we'll specifically discuss how traversal order is important for binary tree traversal.\n\nDFS is a search algorithm that traverses a tree data structure by prioritizing exploring deeper paths from from child node to child node until a leaf node is finally visited or some condition is met. When visiting each node in a binary tree, the DFS algorithm has three operations it needs to perform in some order: \"visit the node\", which means perform some work (eg. print the value, add to some counter, delete it, etc), traverse down the left subtree, and traverse down the right subtree. The order of these three operations has a huge impact on the ultimate traversal order, so we further subdivide DFS into preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal.\n\nAs an alternative to DFS, [the BFS algorithm](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n prioritizes visiting all the direct children at the same level before moving deeper into the tree. With this pattern, there is only one possible traversal order, which is called level-order traversal.\n\nLet's explore these traversal orders more closely.\n\n### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n\n![a simple binary search tree consisting of nine nodes, with a height of four.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image2_43e1c4c5b9.png)\n\nConsider an example where we are printing all the nodes of the binary search tree from before using a DFS traversal.\n\n#### Inorder Traversal\n\nInorder traversal is a process for visiting each node in a binary tree by first visiting the left subtree, then the node itself, and then the right subtree. With inorder traversal, the path always favors the leftmost tree before traversing the rest.\n\n![binary search tree consisting of nine nodes and a height of four, with labels indicating the traversal order for inorder traversal.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image4_d33dfe35b2.png)\n\nThe sequence produced with inorder traversal: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14.\n\nIn a binary search tree, inorder traversal results in visiting the nodes in ascending order. This is because by favoring resolving the left subtree at each node, at each node we are always moving toward the smallest value available and returning the inorder successor.\n\nJava\n\n    void inorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n            // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n            if (node != null) {\n                // recurse on left child\n                inorderTraversal(node.left);\n                \n                // visit current node\n                System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n                \n                // recurse on right child\n                inorderTraversal(node.right);\n            }\n    }\n\n    1void inorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n    2        // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n    3        if (node != null) {\n    4            // recurse on left child\n    5            inorderTraversal(node.left);\n    6            \n    7            // visit current node\n    8            System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n    9            \n    10            // recurse on right child\n    11            inorderTraversal(node.right);\n    12        }\n    13}\n\n#### Preorder Traversal\n\nPreorder traversal visits each node in the tree by first visiting the node itself, then traversing the left subtree, and finally traversing the right subtree. In each recursive call, the function first prints (or \"visits\") the current node, then calls the recursive function on the left subtree, and finally on the right subtree.\n\n![binary search tree consisting of nine nodes and a height of four, with labels indicating the traversal order for preorder traversal.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image6_3575a285d6.png)\n\nThe sequence produced with preorder traversal: 8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14, 13\n\nJava\n\n    void preorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n            // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n            if (node != null) {\n    \t// visit current node\n                System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n    \n                // recurse on left child\n                preorderTraversal(node.left);\n                \n                // recurse on right child\n                preorderTraversal(node.right);\n            }\n    }\n\n    1void preorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n    2        // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n    3        if (node != null) {\n    4\t// visit current node\n    5            System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n    6\n    7            // recurse on left child\n    8            preorderTraversal(node.left);\n    9            \n    10            // recurse on right child\n    11            preorderTraversal(node.right);\n    12        }\n    13}\n\n#### Postorder Traversal\n\nIn each recursive call, the function first performs DFS on the left subtree, then performs DFS on the right subtree, and finally visits the current node.\n\n![binary search tree consisting of nine nodes and a height of four, with labels indicating the traversal order for postorder traversal.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image7_f33d43fb7d.png)\n\nThe sequence produced with postorder traversal: 7, 6, 4, 1, 3, 13, 14, 8\n\nJava\n\n    void postorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n            // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n            if (node != null) {\n                // recurse on left child\n                postorderTraversal(node.left);\n                \n                // recurse on right child\n                postorderTraversal(node.right);\n    \n    \t// visit current node\n                System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n            }\n    }\n\n    1void postorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n    2        // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n    3        if (node != null) {\n    4            // recurse on left child\n    5            postorderTraversal(node.left);\n    6            \n    7            // recurse on right child\n    8            postorderTraversal(node.right);\n    9\n    10\t// visit current node\n    11            System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n    12        }\n    13}\n\nPostorder traversal is often used to delete the nodes of a tree in a specific order, because we can easily reconstruct the node references. We are basically marking the exact path of the recursive calls by immediately printing each node as it is visited.\n\n### Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n\n#### Level Order Traversal\n\nAs an alternative to using DFS we can also traverse a binary tree using Breadth-First Search (BFS), where we visit each node belonging to the same level before moving deeper into the tree. BFS uses a queue data structure (instead of a stack or recursion), in order to maintain the level-order traversal.\n\n![binary search tree consisting of nine nodes and a height of four, with labels indicating the traversal order for level-order traversal.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image5_fc86175422.png)\n\nThe sequence produced with level order traversal: 8, 3, 10, 1, 6, 14, 4, 7, 13\n\nLevel order traversal in a binary tree is often applied to problems where we need to process tree nodes by level, or if we want to find the shortest distance between two nodes.\n\nJava\n\n    public static void levelOrderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\n        if (root == null)\n            return;\n    \n        Queue < TreeNode > queue = new LinkedList < > ();\n        queue.offer(root);\n    \n        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {\n            TreeNode node = queue.poll();\n            System.out.print(node.val + \" \");\n    \n            if (node.left != null)\n                queue.offer(node.left);\n    \n            if (node.right != null)\n                queue.offer(node.right);\n        }\n    }\n\n    1public static void levelOrderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\n    2    if (root == null)\n    3        return;\n    4\n    5    Queue < TreeNode > queue = new LinkedList < > ();\n    6    queue.offer(root);\n    7\n    8    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {\n    9        TreeNode node = queue.poll();\n    10        System.out.print(node.val + \" \");\n    11\n    12        if (node.left != null)\n    13            queue.offer(node.left);\n    14\n    15        if (node.right != null)\n    16            queue.offer(node.right);\n    17    }\n    18}\n\n### Time and Space Complexity\n\nTime complexity: `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes. If we're not explicitly performing binary search, we will visit every node at worst in a traversal.\n\nSpace complexity: `O(n)`, additional space is needed on the call stack when performing recursion.\n\nWhen to Use Binary Trees In Technical Interviews\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of the time, interview questions involving trees will be explicitly stated as such. The problem will come in the form of “Given a tree, do X”. Sometimes, the task may be challenging but not very ambiguous, for example validating a binary search tree. The most important thing when you see problems like this is to make sure that you understand what type of tree you’re dealing with. If it’s a BST, that has different implications than a binary tree that is not sorted, and could provide valuable clues for arriving at an optimal solution.\n\nIn other cases, we might be asked to store data efficiently - this could be an opportunity to implement a BST. A common interview task is to implement the insertion and search functions of a BST, as this is a great way to demonstrate one's understanding of the data structure, so be sure to practice these. Deleting a node from a BST can be asked as well but is often considered an advanced topic.\n\nFor generic binary trees, questions often involve assessing the dimensions of the tree, for example the height or diameter of the tree, or searching specific conditions between two or more nodes in the tree, like LCA or path sum. Here are some areas that come up often in interviews:\n\n1.  Height: Calculate the height of a binary tree (the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node).\n2.  Find Mirror Image: Determine if a binary tree is a mirror image of itself (symmetric).\n3.  Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA): Given two nodes in a binary tree, find their lowest common ancestor node.\n4.  Diameter of a Tree: Calculate the diameter of a binary tree (the length of the longest path between any two nodes).\n5.  Path Sum: Check if there exists a root-to-leaf path in a binary tree that adds up to a given sum. 6.Serialize and Deserialize: Serialize a binary tree into a string representation and deserialize it back to a binary tree.\n\nCommon Mistakes in Interviews Featuring Binary Trees\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Mistaking a Binary Tree for a Binary Search Tree**. Remember that an interviewer might intentionally leave information out of their problem description to leave room for your inquiries. The difference between a general binary tree and a BST will greatly influence the solution you propose.\n*   **Forgetting to consider duplicate keys when implementing a BST**. Paying close attention to implementation details will help demonstrate your familiarity with the data structure.\n*   **Not using visual aids**. Binary tree logic can become very complex, given its recursive nature. Using tree diagrams can help you work through the problem and communicate more effectively with your interviewer.\n*   **Misusing BFS or DFS**. In some binary tree problems, where we don't have a sorted tree or we simply need to visit every node to perform some operation, both traversal algorithms are applicable without any meaningful complexity tradeoff. But a candidate needs to be confident about which situations call for a specific traversal. A common use-case for BFS, for example, is searching for the shortest path between two nodes. DFS on the other hand, is useful to perform on a binary search tree when we want to traverse the nodes in their sorted order.\n*   **Forgetting to set min/max bounds when validating binary search trees**. An incorrect implementation just checks whether node.right.data > node.left.data and node.left.data < node.right.data\n*   **Not knowing how to use recursion within trees**. Trees are inherently recursive data structures, so it's important to be familiar with recursive traversal. It may be obvious how to traverse from parent to child, but using recursive to traverse from child to parent (with return statement) is essential.\n*   **Incorrectly stating space complexity for recursive traversal**. It is easy to forget that recursion doesn't use additional space since we are not introducing a new data structure. But in fact, we are taking advantage of an existing stack call the call stack, which must grow linearly with the number of nodes we are recursing on.\n*   **Forgetting to handle edge cases**. Binary tree nodes can still have zero or one child, so be sure to explicitly check for edge cases. We also need to include base cases for recursive traversals.\n\nClarifying Questions to Ask Your Interviewer About Binary Trees\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Is the input binary tree or a binary search tree?** Clarifying the parameters offered by the interviewer is a great problem-solving skill to demonstrate. In some cases, interviewers will intentionally omit that the binary tree you're working with is actually sorted, so be sure to ask! This of course will have a huge impact on the approach you'll end up taking for your solution.\n*   **Will the input contain duplicate values?** Whether you are streaming values or getting a tree as input, make sure to specify if duplicates need to be handled, as this complicates binary search tree implementation. For binary search trees, this is especially complicated, and will likely be the crux of the problem if the tree contains them. Alternatively, you might be building a BST from a stream of values, and you'll want to be sure you can omit duplicates if its appropriate in the problem.\n*   **How do we handle scenarios where a binary tree is empty or has null nodes?** It is always encouraged to ask about how edge cases should be handled, as some interviewers will be happy enough that you communicated that you are aware of them, and will offer to let you skip implementation.\n*   **What operations need to be supported?** If you'll be implementing a binary tree, make sure to ask your interviewer what operations to prioritize during the interview. In some cases, they can allow you to skip the implementation of some less-important operations.\n*   **What are the characteristics of the input tree?** Be sure to determine if there are any constraints that the input binary tree adheres to, such as balancing or sorting, max height, weighted branches, etc. If so, this would be a clue as to what kind of tree data structure you should focus on during the interview.\n\nHow to Show Mastery of Trees in Interviews\n------------------------------------------\n\n### Know Your BST\n\nOne of the most common topics in software engineering interviews is the Binary Search Tree. You want to be able to showcase your ability to implement binary trees efficiently and correctly. Make sure to practice implementing tree construction, node insertion, deletion, and traversal algorithms.\n\nSpeaking of traversal algorithms - many interview problems test your understanding of the traversal order, especially when working with binary search trees, since the output sequence order is not arbitrary. Be sure to understand the use-cases for preorder, inorder, postorder, and level-order traversals.\n\n### Be Familiar with Recursive and Iterative Implementations of DFS\n\nAlthough trees are inherently recursive, and thus lend themselves to recursive traversal implementations, a candidate should be comfortable with the iterative implementation as well. This helps demonstrate your strong understanding of recursion as well, since we can mimic the recursive mechanism we get from the call stack with a stack we implement ourselves. The above traversals are all recursive - here's an example of an iterative DFS:\n\n#### Iterative DFS\n\nJava\n\n    public static void iterativeDFS(BinaryTreeNode root) {\n        if (root == null)\n            return;\n    \n        Stack < BinaryTreeNode > stack = new Stack < > ();\n        stack.push(root);\n    \n        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {\n            BinaryTreeNode node = stack.pop();\n            System.out.print(node.val + \" \");\n    \n            // Push right child first (since it needs to be processed after left child)\n            if (node.right != null)\n                stack.push(node.right);\n    \n            // Push left child\n            if (node.left != null)\n                stack.push(node.left);\n        }\n    }\n\n    1public static void iterativeDFS(BinaryTreeNode root) {\n    2    if (root == null)\n    3        return;\n    4\n    5    Stack < BinaryTreeNode > stack = new Stack < > ();\n    6    stack.push(root);\n    7\n    8    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {\n    9        BinaryTreeNode node = stack.pop();\n    10        System.out.print(node.val + \" \");\n    11\n    12        // Push right child first (since it needs to be processed after left child)\n    13        if (node.right != null)\n    14            stack.push(node.right);\n    15\n    16        // Push left child\n    17        if (node.left != null)\n    18            stack.push(node.left);\n    19    }\n    20}\n\nCommon Binary Tree interview Questions\n--------------------------------------\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://interviewing.io/questions/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)\n\n[Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.](https://interviewing.io/questions/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Kth Smallest Element](https://interviewing.io/questions/kth-smallest-element)\n\n[Given an integer array and an integer k, return the kth smallest element in the array.](https://interviewing.io/questions/kth-smallest-element)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Longest Common Subsequence](https://interviewing.io/questions/longest-common-subsequence)\n\n[Given two strings, return the longest common subsequence between the two strings.](https://interviewing.io/questions/longest-common-subsequence)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Recover Binary Search Tree](https://interviewing.io/questions/recover-binary-search-tree)\n\n[Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Traversing from the root, insertNode will recursively search for the correct position to add the new node by checking the binary condition: if the currentNode is larger than the new node, traverse left, if the currentNode is smaller than the new node, traverse right. Search will apply the same logic, but return if the target is found.\n\n#### Insert\n\nJava\n\n    private BinaryTreeNode insertNode(BinaryTreeNode root, int key) {\n            if (root == null) {\n                return new BinaryTreeNode(key);\n            }\n    \n            if (key < root.data) {\n                root.left = insertNode(root.left, key);\n            } else if (key > root.data) {\n                root.right = insertNode(root.right, key);\n            }\n            \n            // if the input key already exists, we don't do anything.\n            return currentNode;\n        }\n\n    1private BinaryTreeNode insertNode(BinaryTreeNode root, int key) {\n    2        if (root == null) {\n    3            return new BinaryTreeNode(key);\n    4        }\n    5\n    6        if (key < root.data) {\n    7            root.left = insertNode(root.left, key);\n    8        } else if (key > root.data) {\n    9            root.right = insertNode(root.right, key);\n    10        }\n    11        \n    12        // if the input key already exists, we don't do anything.\n    13        return currentNode;\n    14    }\n\n#### Delete\n\njava\n\n    private BinaryTreeNode deleteNode(BinaryTreeNode root, Integer key) {\n            if (root == null) {\n                return root;\n            }\n            \n            if (key < root.data) {\n                root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);\n            } else if (data > root.data) {\n                root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);\n            } else {\n                // Node to be deleted is found\n                \n                // Case 1: Node has no child or only one child\n                if (root.left == null) {\n                    return root.right;\n                } else if (root.right == null) {\n                    return root.left;\n                }\n                \n                // Case 2: Node has two children\n                root.data = minValue(root.right);\n                root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.data);\n            }\n            \n            return root;\n        }\n    \n    private Integer minValue(BinaryTreeNode root) {\n            Integer minValue = root.data;\n            while (root.left != null) {\n                 minValue = root.left.data;\n                 root = root.left\n            }\n            return minValue;\n    }\n\n    1private BinaryTreeNode deleteNode(BinaryTreeNode root, Integer key) {\n    2        if (root == null) {\n    3            return root;\n    4        }\n    5        \n    6        if (key < root.data) {\n    7            root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);\n    8        } else if (data > root.data) {\n    9            root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);\n    10        } else {\n    11            // Node to be deleted is found\n    12            \n    13            // Case 1: Node has no child or only one child\n    14            if (root.left == null) {\n    15                return root.right;\n    16            } else if (root.right == null) {\n    17                return root.left;\n    18            }\n    19            \n    20            // Case 2: Node has two children\n    21            root.data = minValue(root.right);\n    22            root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.data);\n    23        }\n    24        \n    25        return root;\n    26    }\n    27\n    28private Integer minValue(BinaryTreeNode root) {\n    29        Integer minValue = root.data;\n    30        while (root.left != null) {\n    31             minValue = root.left.data;\n    32             root = root.left\n    33        }\n    34        return minValue;\n    35}\n\nCompanies That Ask Binary Tree Questions\n----------------------------------------\n\nTraversal Order in a Binary Tree\n--------------------------------\n\nA common task with binary trees is traversing the data structure, since without random access, this is the only way to do anything with our data: search, add, delete, print, etc. In addition to selecting an appropriate traversal algorithm, we also need to determine the order in which we want to visit the nodes.\n\nAt a high level, there are two types of traversals: depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). To explore these algorithms generally, you should read more about [DFS](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n and [BFS](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n. But in this article, we'll specifically discuss how traversal order is important for binary tree traversal.\n\nDFS is a search algorithm that traverses a tree data structure by prioritizing exploring deeper paths from from child node to child node until a leaf node is finally visited or some condition is met. When visiting each node in a binary tree, the DFS algorithm has three operations it needs to perform in some order: \"visit the node\", which means perform some work (eg. print the value, add to some counter, delete it, etc), traverse down the left subtree, and traverse down the right subtree. The order of these three operations has a huge impact on the ultimate traversal order, so we further subdivide DFS into preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal.\n\nAs an alternative to DFS, [the BFS algorithm](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n prioritizes visiting all the direct children at the same level before moving deeper into the tree. With this pattern, there is only one possible traversal order, which is called level-order traversal.\n\nLet's explore these traversal orders more closely.",

With inorder traversal, the path always favors the leftmost tree before traversing the rest.\n\n![binary search tree consisting of nine nodes and a height of four, with labels indicating the traversal order for inorder traversal.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image4_d33dfe35b2.png)\n\nThe sequence produced with inorder traversal: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14.\n\nIn a binary search tree, inorder traversal results in visiting the nodes in ascending order. This is because by favoring resolving the left subtree at each node, at each node we are always moving toward the smallest value available and returning the inorder successor.\n\nJava\n\n    void inorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n            // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n            if (node != null) {\n                // recurse on left child\n                inorderTraversal(node.left);\n                \n                // visit current node\n                System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n                \n                // recurse on right child\n                inorderTraversal(node.right);\n            }\n    }\n\n    1void inorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n    2        // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n    3        if (node != null) {\n    4            // recurse on left child\n    5            inorderTraversal(node.left);\n    6            \n    7            // visit current node\n    8            System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n    9            \n    10            // recurse on right child\n    11            inorderTraversal(node.right);\n    12        }\n    13}\n\n#### Preorder Traversal\n\nPreorder traversal visits each node in the tree by first visiting the node itself, then traversing the left subtree, and finally traversing the right subtree. In each recursive call, the function first prints (or \"visits\") the current node, then calls the recursive function on the left subtree, and finally on the right subtree.\n\n![binary search tree consisting of nine nodes and a height of four, with labels indicating the traversal order for preorder traversal.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image6_3575a285d6.png)\n\nThe sequence produced with preorder traversal: 8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14, 13\n\nJava\n\n    void preorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n            // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n            if (node != null) {\n    \t// visit current node\n                System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n    \n                // recurse on left child\n                preorderTraversal(node.left);\n                \n                // recurse on right child\n                preorderTraversal(node.right);\n            }\n    }\n\n    1void preorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n    2        // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n    3        if (node != null) {\n    4\t// visit current node\n    5            System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n    6\n    7            // recurse on left child\n    8            preorderTraversal(node.left);\n    9            \n    10            // recurse on right child\n    11            preorderTraversal(node.right);\n    12        }\n    13}\n\n#### Postorder Traversal\n\nIn each recursive call, the function first performs DFS on the left subtree, then performs DFS on the right subtree, and finally visits the current node.\n\n![binary search tree consisting of nine nodes and a height of four, with labels indicating the traversal order for postorder traversal.](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image7_f33d43fb7d.png)\n\nThe sequence produced with postorder traversal: 7, 6, 4, 1, 3, 13, 14, 8\n\nJava\n\n    void postorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n            // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n            if (node != null) {\n                // recurse on left child\n                postorderTraversal(node.left);\n                \n                // recurse on right child\n                postorderTraversal(node.right);\n    \n    \t// visit current node\n                System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n            }\n    }\n\n    1void postorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode node) {\n    2        // base case: if node is null, do nothing\n    3        if (node != null) {\n    4            // recurse on left child\n    5            postorderTraversal(node.left);\n    6            \n    7            // recurse on right child\n    8            postorderTraversal(node.right);\n    9\n    10\t// visit current node\n    11            System.out.print(node.data + \" \");\n    12        }\n    13}\n\nPostorder traversal is often used to delete the nodes of a tree in a specific order, because we can easily reconstruct the node references.

If we're not explicitly performing binary search, we will visit every node at worst in a traversal. Space complexity: `O(n)`, additional space is needed on the call stack when performing recursion. When to Use Binary Trees In Technical Interviews ------------------------------------------------ Most of the time, interview questions involving trees will be explicitly stated as such. The problem will come in the form of “Given a tree, do X”. Sometimes, the task may be challenging but not very ambiguous, for example validating a binary search tree. The most important thing when you see problems like this is to make sure that you understand what type of tree you’re dealing with. If it’s a BST, that has different implications than a binary tree that is not sorted, and could provide valuable clues for arriving at an optimal solution. In other cases, we might be asked to store data efficiently - this could be an opportunity to implement a BST. A common interview task is to implement the insertion and search functions of a BST, as this is a great way to demonstrate one's understanding of the data structure, so be sure to practice these. Deleting a node from a BST can be asked as well but is often considered an advanced topic. For generic binary trees, questions often involve assessing the dimensions of the tree, for example the height or diameter of the tree, or searching specific conditions between two or more nodes in the tree, like LCA or path sum. Here are some areas that come up often in interviews: 1. Height: Calculate the height of a binary tree (the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node). 2. Find Mirror Image: Determine if a binary tree is a mirror image of itself (symmetric). 3. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA): Given two nodes in a binary tree, find their lowest common ancestor node. 4. Diameter of a Tree: Calculate the diameter of a binary tree (the length of the longest path between any two nodes). 5. Path Sum: Check if there exists a root-to-leaf path in a binary tree that adds up to a given sum. 6.Serialize and Deserialize: Serialize a binary tree into a string representation and deserialize it back to a binary tree. Common Mistakes in Interviews Featuring Binary Trees ---------------------------------------------------- * **Mistaking a Binary Tree for a Binary Search Tree**. Remember that an interviewer might intentionally leave information out of their problem description to leave room for your inquiries. The difference between a general binary tree and a BST will greatly influence the solution you propose. * **Forgetting to consider duplicate keys when implementing a BST**. Paying close attention to implementation details will help demonstrate your familiarity with the data structure. * **Not using visual aids**. Binary tree logic can become very complex, given its recursive nature. Using tree diagrams can help you work through the problem and communicate more effectively with your interviewer. * **Misusing BFS or DFS**. In some binary tree problems, where we don't have a sorted tree or we simply need to visit every node to perform some operation, both traversal algorithms are applicable without any meaningful complexity tradeoff. But a candidate needs to be confident about which situations call for a specific traversal. A common use-case for BFS, for example, is searching for the shortest path between two nodes. DFS on the other hand, is useful to perform on a binary search tree when we want to traverse the nodes in their sorted order. * **Forgetting to set min/max bounds when validating binary search trees**. An incorrect implementation just checks whether node.right.data > node.left.data and node.left.data < node.right.data * **Not knowing how to use recursion within trees**. Trees are inherently recursive data structures, so it's important to be familiar with recursive traversal. It may be obvious how to traverse from parent to child, but using recursive to traverse from child to parent (with return statement) is essential. * **Incorrectly stating space complexity for recursive traversal**. It is easy to forget that recursion doesn't use additional space since we are not introducing a new data structure. But in fact, we are taking advantage of an existing stack call the call stack, which must grow linearly with the number of nodes we are recursing on. * **Forgetting to handle edge cases**. Binary tree nodes can still have zero or one child, so be sure to explicitly check for edge cases. We also need to include base cases for recursive traversals. Clarifying Questions to Ask Your Interviewer About Binary Trees --------------------------------------------------------------- * **Is the input binary tree or a binary search tree?** Clarifying the parameters offered by the interviewer is a great problem-solving skill to demonstrate. In some cases, interviewers will intentionally omit that the binary tree you're working with is actually sorted, so be sure to ask! This of course will have a huge impact on the approach you'll end up taking for your solution. * **Will the input contain duplicate values?** Whether you are streaming values or getting a tree as input, make sure to specify if duplicates need to be handled, as this complicates binary search tree implementation. For binary search trees, this is especially complicated, and will likely be the crux of the problem if the tree contains them. Alternatively, you might be building a BST from a stream of values, and you'll want to be sure you can omit duplicates if its appropriate in the problem. * **How do we handle scenarios where a binary tree is empty or has null nodes?** It is always encouraged to ask about how edge cases should be handled, as some interviewers will be happy enough that you communicated that you are aware of them, and will offer to let you skip implementation.",

In some cases, they can allow you to skip the implementation of some less-important operations. * **What are the characteristics of the input tree?** Be sure to determine if there are any constraints that the input binary tree adheres to, such as balancing or sorting, max height, weighted branches, etc. If so, this would be a clue as to what kind of tree data structure you should focus on during the interview.

The above traversals are all recursive - here's an example of an iterative DFS:\n\n#### Iterative DFS\n\nJava\n\n    public static void iterativeDFS(BinaryTreeNode root) {\n        if (root == null)\n            return;\n    \n        Stack < BinaryTreeNode > stack = new Stack < > ();\n        stack.push(root);\n    \n        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {\n            BinaryTreeNode node = stack.pop();\n            System.out.print(node.val + \" \");\n    \n            // Push right child first (since it needs to be processed after left child)\n            if (node.right != null)\n                stack.push(node.right);\n    \n            // Push left child\n            if (node.left != null)\n                stack.push(node.left);\n        }\n    }\n\n    1public static void iterativeDFS(BinaryTreeNode root) {\n    2    if (root == null)\n    3        return;\n    4\n    5    Stack < BinaryTreeNode > stack = new Stack < > ();\n    6    stack.push(root);\n    7\n    8    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {\n    9        BinaryTreeNode node = stack.pop();\n    10        System.out.print(node.val + \" \");\n    11\n    12        // Push right child first (since it needs to be processed after left child)\n    13        if (node.right != null)\n    14            stack.push(node.right);\n    15\n    16        // Push left child\n    17        if (node.left != null)\n    18            stack.push(node.left);\n    19    }\n    20}\n\nCommon Binary Tree interview Questions\n--------------------------------------\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms",

Traversal is the process of systematically visiting each node exactly once following a specific order or pattern. This allows us to search for a node or to trace a specific path through the data structure.\n\nUnlike a linear data structure like an [array](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n or a [linked list](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n - where each node points to only one subsequent node - [graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n and [trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n offer multiple distinct paths to take through the structure. The example below illustrates the many paths that exist through a tree and the single path through a linked list.\n\n![A simple graph consisting of seven nodes highlighting the various distinct paths through the graph. A singly-linked linked-list consisting of four nodes, highlighting the single linear path through the list](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphs_and_linked_lists_a2772c3367.png)\n\nDifferent traversal algorithms will produce different traversal orders - knowing which to deploy and when enables us to solve problems more efficiently, and sometimes offers the only way to solve a particular problem. Let's look at how a specific traversal algorithm can be used! At the highest level, there are two main traversal algorithms: [Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n, which is further distinguished with pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal when specifically considering DFS in a binary tree, and Breadth-First Search (BFS). In this article, we'll focus on BFS.\n\nKeep in mind that while we can manipulate the traversal path with different algorithms, unless the data structure is ordered in a particular way (like a BST) or our algorithm applies additional logic to omit certain paths, each traversal algorithm will ultimately visit each node once. DFS and BFS are considered blind search algorithms as they do not apply any domain-driven heuristic. Instead, the algorithms only apply traversal rules and a terminal case to determine if a goal state is reached.\n\n**Note**: Since trees are merely directional, acyclic graphs, we'll just refer to both as graphs in the remainder of this article. Everything discussed below is relevant to trees as well as generic graphs, and in cases where that's not true, it will be pointed out as such.\n\nWhat is Breadth-First Search (BFS)?\n-----------------------------------\n\nBreadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing tree or graph data structures. Given a node, the algorithm explores all the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next level neighbors, repeating this process until there are no more nodes to visit.\n\nUnlike depth-first search, which traverses as far as possible down a branch as it processes nodes, breadth-first search explores the graph level by level - it's often also referred to as level-order traversal. The result is that all the nodes on a single level are visited at once and grouped together.\n\n![Simple binary tree consisting of five nodes, highlighting the groupings of nodes by level](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bfs_layers_28b456f705.png)\n\nStarting at the root node, the algorithm visits all the neighbor nodes of a particular node, as well as all the neighbor nodes of the parents at the same level as our current node, before moving to the next level.\n\nCompanies That Ask Breadth-First Search (BFS) Questions\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![Google](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgoogle_com_128x128_2818837343.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Google](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Watch 40  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=google)\n\n[![Amazon](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Famazon_128x128_15213fbc98.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Watch 31  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=amazon)\n\n[![Apple](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fapple_com_128x128_61116200e1.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Apple](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=apple)\n\n[![Airbnb](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fairbnb_com_128x128_f1749fbd52.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/airbnb-interview-questions)\n\n[Airbnb](https://interviewing.io/airbnb-interview-questions)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/airbnb-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=airbnb)\n\n[![Slack](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fslack_com_128x128_5be1561d21.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/slack-interview-questions)\n\n[Slack](https://interviewing.io/slack-interview-questions)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/slack-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 1  \\\ninterview replay](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=slack)\n\nBFS Implementation\n------------------\n\nBFS typically uses a queue data structure to store the nodes that are waiting to be explored, guaranteeing a FIFO processing order. When a node is visited, all its neighbors are added to the queue in the order they are found. The next node that is visited is grabbed from the front of the queue, whose neighbors are also added to the queue - the queue ensures that nodes are visited in the order they were added. The process continues until all the nodes have been explored or a target state is found.\n\nHere's an overview of the BFS algorithm:\n\n1.  Create a visited set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n2.  Create a queue data structure (FIFO) to store the nodes to be processed.\n3.  Enqueue the starting node onto the queue and mark it as visited.\n4.  While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:\n    *   Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n    *   Process the dequeued node (e.g., print or perform operations).\n    *   Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node onto the queue and mark them as visited.\n5.  Repeat step 4 until the queue becomes empty.\n\nImagine we have a graph with the following node structure:\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, id):\n            self._id = id\n            self._neighbors = []\n    \n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, id):\n    3        self._id = id\n    4        self._neighbors = []\n    5\n\nBFS will iteratively add elements to a queue processing all the neighbor nodes until none are left.\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    class Graph:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.visited = set()\n    \n        def bfs(self, start_node):\n            queue = deque([start_node])\n    \n            # Mark the starting node as visited\n            self.visited.add(start_node)\n    \n            while queue:\n                # Dequeue a node from the front of the queue\n                current_node = queue.popleft()\n    \n                # Process the dequeued node\n                print(current_node.id)\n    \n                for neighbor in current_node.neighbors:\n                    if neighbor not in self.visited:\n                        # Enqueue unvisited neighbors\n                        queue.append(neighbor)\n                        # Mark the neighbor as visited\n                        self.visited.add(neighbor)\n    \n    # Create Nodes and add neighbors\n    node1 = Node(1)\n    node2 = Node(2)\n    node3 = Node(3)\n    node1.add_neighbor(node2)\n    node2.add_neighbor(node3)\n    \n    # Create a Graph object and perform BFS\n    g = Graph()\n    g.bfs(node1)\n    \n\n    1from collections import deque\n    2\n    3class Graph:\n    4    def __init__(self):\n    5        self.visited = set()\n    6\n    7    def bfs(self, start_node):\n    8        queue = deque([start_node])\n    9\n    10        # Mark the starting node as visited\n    11        self.visited.add(start_node)\n    12\n    13        while queue:\n    14            # Dequeue a node from the front of the queue\n    15            current_node = queue.popleft()\n    16\n    17            # Process the dequeued node\n    18            print(current_node.id)\n    19\n    20            for neighbor in current_node.neighbors:\n    21                if neighbor not in self.visited:\n    22                    # Enqueue unvisited neighbors\n    23                    queue.append(neighbor)\n    24                    # Mark the neighbor as visited\n    25                    self.visited.add(neighbor)\n    26\n    27# Create Nodes and add neighbors\n    28node1 = Node(1)\n    29node2 = Node(2)\n    30node3 = Node(3)\n    31node1.add_neighbor(node2)\n    32node2.add_neighbor(node3)\n    33\n    34# Create a Graph object and perform BFS\n    35g = Graph()\n    36g.bfs(node1)\n    37\n\nBFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph or finding the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph. It is also used for finding all nodes in a graph that are at a certain distance from a given node.\n\n#### Time and Space Complexity\n\nTime and Space Complexity Time complexity: `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. Space complexity: `O(V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices. This primarily depends on the storage of the visited vertices and the queue used for traversal\n\n#### Time and Space Complexity\n\nTime complexity: `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges, as it must process each vertex and each edge exactly once. Space complexity: `O(V`), where `V` is the number of vertices, as it requires a position in the stack for each vertex.\n\nWhen to Use BFS in Technical Interviews\n---------------------------------------\n\n*   **Finding the shortest distance between two nodes**: Problems that require finding the shortest path between nodes are surely meant to test your understanding of BFS. This is often implemented in problems that involve a matrix or a graph that models some physical space, where we are asked to find the shortest distance between two particular cells. BFS prioritizes the nearest nodes first when traversing, which means we can use it to find the shortest path between two nodes, or the minimum number of steps required to reach a goal node or condition.\n*   **When we need to compare a parent to its direct children**: Since BFS explores all neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level, this algorithm is useful in scenarios where we want to consider all the children before moving on. This is useful in problems where we need to analyze the relationship between all parents and their direct children.\n*   **When we need to print or analyze data by level in the graph or tree**: BFS is also sometimes referred to as \"level-order traversal\", since we can track all the nodes at a given level. It's useful when we need to batch together all nodes that are at a given level in a tree, or at a given level in a graph relative to some starting node.\n*   **When we want to visit nodes in increasing order of their distance from a start node**: Since BFS allows us to track the depth of the algorithm relative to the starting node, it is useful in scenarios where we need to systematically visit nodes at increasing depths from a start node.\n\nCommon Mistakes in Interviews Featuring BFS\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Misunderstanding the tradeoffs and benefits between DFS and BFS**: Remember that in many cases both will do just fine, with little to no tradeoffs, but there are specific cases when we should use BFS (finding the shortest distance between two nodes, for example).\n*   **Not using the correct supporting data structure**: BFS is made possible with a queue data structure, while DFS relies on a stack. It's important to be able to identify this when implementing, and to be sure not to use the wrong supporting data structure.\n*   **Forgetting to track visited nodes**: When dealing with a graph that is not guaranteed to be directed and acyclic, it is essential to track visited nodes in order to avoid an infinite loop. Interviewers will be looking for this as a common pitfall. One way to ensure you don't forget is to perform a manual dry-run of your algorithm.\n*   **Choosing BFS over DFS when it's not needed**: Although in many cases these are both interchangeable, one big benefit of using DFS for backtracking algorithms is that memoization can be implemented easily.\n\nCommon BFS interview Questions\n------------------------------\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Number of Islands](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands)\n\n[Given a 2D matrix, where \"1\" represents land and \"0\" represents water, count how many islands are present.](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Walls and Gates](https://interviewing.io/questions/walls-and-gates)\n\n[You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

Traversal is the process of systematically visiting each node exactly once following a specific order or pattern. This allows us to search for a node or to trace a specific path through the data structure.\n\nUnlike a linear data structure like an [array](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n or a [linked list](https://interviewing.io/linked-lists-interview-questions)\n - where each node points to only one subsequent node - [graphs](https://interviewing.io/graphs-interview-questions)\n and [trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions)\n offer multiple distinct paths to take through the structure. The example below illustrates the many paths that exist through a tree and the single path through a linked list.\n\n![A simple graph consisting of seven nodes highlighting the various distinct paths through the graph. A singly-linked linked-list consisting of four nodes, highlighting the single linear path through the list](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphs_and_linked_lists_a2772c3367.png)\n\nDifferent traversal algorithms will produce different traversal orders - knowing which to deploy and when enables us to solve problems more efficiently, and sometimes offers the only way to solve a particular problem. Let's look at how a specific traversal algorithm can be used! At the highest level, there are two main traversal algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), which is further distinguished with pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal when specifically considering DFS in a binary tree, and [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n. In this article, we'll focus on DFS.\n\nKeep in mind that while we can manipulate the traversal path with different algorithms, unless the data structure is ordered in a particular way (like a BST) or our algorithm applies additional logic to omit certain paths, each traversal algorithm will ultimately visit each node once. DFS and BFS are considered blind search algorithms as they do not apply any domain-driven heuristic. Instead, the algorithms only apply traversal rules and a terminal case to determine if a goal state is reached.\n\n**Note**: Since trees are merely directional, acyclic graphs, we'll just refer to both as graphs in the remainder of this article. Everything discussed below is relevant to trees as well as generic graphs, and in cases where that's not true, it will be pointed out as such.\n\nWhat is Depth-First Search (DFS)?\n---------------------------------\n\nDepth-First Search (DFS) is a type of search algorithm that explores a graph by traversing as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's considered \"depth-first\" because at each node, if there are children, the algorithm always explores deeper paths until a leaf node is finally visited or some condition is met. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores the left and right subtrees by going deeper into the tree as it processes nodes, instead of visiting all the children of a given node before moving on.\n\nThere are many paths that DFS can take, given that each node can have multiple children. In fact, DFS is commonly used as a fundamental technique for backtracking algorithms - backtracking involves exploring all possible solutions to a problem (represented as paths through the data structure) by incrementally building a candidate path and undoing or \"backtracking\" when a solution is found to be invalid.\n\nFor binary trees, a very specific kind of graph, the order of the DFS has a big impact on the ultimate traversal order, and is very important when considering a DFS implementation.

We define a function that takes a node as an argument, which handles doing work on the current node (eg. printing the value) and initiating subsequent recursive calls on its children. Note that in some implementations, we will also use a set to track already visited nodes - this is important if we don't know if the graph is acyclic, otherwise we'll cause an infinite loop.\n\nHere are the algorithm steps:\n\n1.  Create a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n2.  Define a recursive function (`dfs`) that takes the current `Node` as a parameter.\n3.  Mark the current node as visited by adding it to the `visited` set.\n4.  Process the current node. This could involve performing any desired operations on the node or checking if it matches some search criteria.\n5.  Iterate through the `neighbors` of the current node. For each unvisited neighbor, recursively call the `dfs` function with that neighbor as the argument.\n6.  Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all unvisited neighbors until there are no more unvisited neighbors or the search criteria are met.\n\nImagine we have a graph with the following node structure:\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, id):\n            self._id = id\n            self._neighbors = []\n    \n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, id):\n    3        self._id = id\n    4        self._neighbors = []\n    5\n\nDFS will recursively call itself on each neighbor of the node. Below, we implement the algorithm using this adjacency list graph, but the same idea would apply for graphs represented using an adjacency matrix or a Von Neumann neighborhood. The neighbor retrieval would only be different.\n\nAdditionally, changing the order in which we iterate over the neighbors will also change the ultimate traversal order. This is especially important when dealing with [binary search trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions#what-is-a-bst)\n, where the nodes are sorted in some way.\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    class Graph:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.visited = set()\n    \n        def dfs(self, node):\n            # Mark the current node as visited\n            self.visited.add(node)\n    \n            # Process the current node\n            print(node)\n    \n            # Iterate through neighbors\n            for neighbor in node._neighbors:\n                if neighbor not in self.visited:\n                    # Recursive call with unvisited neighbors\n                    self.dfs(neighbor)\n    \n    # Create a Graph object\n    g = Graph()\n    # Assuming that startNode is already defined\n    g.dfs(startNode)\n    \n\n    1class Graph:\n    2    def __init__(self):\n    3        self.visited = set()\n    4\n    5    def dfs(self, node):\n    6        # Mark the current node as visited\n    7        self.visited.add(node)\n    8\n    9        # Process the current node\n    10        print(node)\n    11\n    12        # Iterate through neighbors\n    13        for neighbor in node._neighbors:\n    14            if neighbor not in self.visited:\n    15                # Recursive call with unvisited neighbors\n    16                self.dfs(neighbor)\n    17\n    18# Create a Graph object\n    19g = Graph()\n    20# Assuming that startNode is already defined\n    21g.dfs(startNode)\n    22\n\nWe begin the traversal by passing the root in as an argument. The function calls itself by passing in the current node's neighbors as arguments for subsequent calls, and a new instance of the function is instantiated as a new frame on the call stack.\n\n![Diagram illustrating how the call stack keeps track of the path taken by a recursive DFS traversal](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dfs_call_stack_747a143bc8.png)\n\nBy using a recursive function, the algorithm keeps track of the nodes that need to be visited with the use of the call stack. When each call eventually returns – meaning, all child nodes have been traversed – the algorithm is effectively transported back to the moment that a given call was initialized.\n\n### Iterative DFS\n\nAlthough the structure of graphs lend themselves to recursive algorithms, this does not mean that one cannot also use iteration to traverse. Recursion is used in order to take advantage of the call stack - but we can also implement a stack of our own, removing the need for recursion.\n\nIterative approaches to DFS traversal involve using a loop and a stack for traversal. Using a while loop to iterate, a stack can be used to keep track of the nodes that still need to be visited, ensuring that the most recently added nodes, the closest parents, are visited first. This approach allows for efficient traversal of the tree and requires slightly less memory than recursive approaches, albeit no asymptotic change occurs.\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    class Graph:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.visited = set()\n    \n        def dfs(self, node):\n            stack = [node]\n    \n            while stack:\n                # Pop the top node from the stack\n                current_node = stack.pop()\n    \n                if current_node not in self.visited:\n                    # Mark the current node as visited\n                    self.visited.add(current_node)\n    \n                    # Process the current node\n                    print(current_node)\n    \n                    for neighbor in current_node._neighbors:\n                        # Push unvisited neighbors onto the stack\n                        stack.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # Create a Graph object\n    g = Graph()\n    # Assuming that startNode is already defined\n    g.dfs(startNode)\n    \n\n    1class Graph:\n    2    def __init__(self):\n    3        self.visited = set()\n    4\n    5    def dfs(self, node):\n    6        stack = [node]\n    7\n    8        while stack:\n    9            # Pop the top node from the stack\n    10            current_node = stack.pop()\n    11\n    12            if current_node not in self.visited:\n    13                # Mark the current node as visited\n    14                self.visited.add(current_node)\n    15\n    16                # Process the current node\n    17                print(current_node)\n    18\n    19                for neighbor in current_node._neighbors:\n    20                    # Push unvisited neighbors onto the stack\n    21                    stack.append(neighbor)\n    22\n    23# Create a Graph object\n    24g = Graph()\n    25# Assuming that startNode is already defined\n    26g.dfs(startNode)\n    27\n\n#### Time and Space Complexity\n\nTime complexity: `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges, as it must process each vertex and each edge exactly once. Space complexity: `O(V`), where `V` is the number of vertices, as it requires a position in the stack for each vertex.\n\nWhen to Use DFS in Technical Interviews\n---------------------------------------\n\nRecall that in an acyclic graph, or a tree, all traversal algorithms will visit each node at least once, so for many problems that require basic search, both DFS and BFS will suffice. But there are certain problems where DFS is preferable:\n\n*   **DFS is particularly useful for backtracking algorithms**: When we need to explore all possible paths, and reverse course when a leaf node or some other condition is met, DFS allows for a convenient way to analyze various paths. Examples of problems like this are those where we are calculating the path sum - adding together the values of the nodes - either searching for the max or optimal sum.\n*   **When there could be an opportunity to cache duplicate operations**: If you're dealing with a graph or a tree that might include overlapping subproblems, you'll want to implement your traversal with DFS so it's easy to cache or memoize the sub-solutions. A classic example of a memoization use-case is when solving fibonacci with recursion - this algorithm effectively imagines the fibonacci resolution as a decision tree which is traversed with a DFS-like recursive algorithm.\n*   **If there is an exponential branching factor**: Memoized DFS is also important to consider if the branching factor of the recursion is exponential, as the volume of computations could be costly.\n*   **In most cases, DFS is slightly more memory efficient than BFS, (though not always)**: This is worth mentioning if you're in a situation where both algorithms are applicable. In a tree, the space usage for DFS is defined as `O(height)`, where height is effectively the number of levels in the tree. BFS, on the other hand, uses `O(branching factor ^ height)`, where `branching factor` is the max or average number of children per node. As such, if `height < branchingFactor ^ height`, then DFS is more space efficient. This is rarely not the case. The absolute time complexity is unlikely to change here though, so the difference in an asymptotic sense is negligible.\n\nCommon Mistakes in Interviews Featuring DFS\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Misunderstanding the tradeoffs and benefits between DFS and BFS**: Remember that in many cases both will do just fine, with little to no tradeoffs, but there are specific cases when we should use BFS (finding the shortest distance between two nodes, for example).\n*   **Not using the correct supporting data structure**: BFS is made possible with a queue data structure, while DFS relies on a stack. It's important to be able to identify this when implementing, and to be sure not to use the wrong supporting data structure.\n*   **Forgetting to track visited nodes**: When dealing with a graph that is not guaranteed to be directed and acyclic, it is essential to track visited nodes in order to avoid an infinite loop. Interviewers will be looking for this as a common pitfall. One way to ensure you don't forget is to perform a manual dry-run of your algorithm.\n*   **Choosing BFS over DFS when it's not needed**: Although in many cases these are both interchangeable, one big benefit of using DFS for backtracking algorithms is that memoization can be implemented easily.\n\nCommon Depth-First Search (DFS) interview Questions\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nMEDIUM\n\n### [Find Leaves of a Binary Tree](https://interviewing.io/questions/find-leaves-of-binary-tree)\n\n[Given a binary tree, extract all the leaves in repeated succession into a list of lists by starting at the bottom and working your way upwards.](https://interviewing.io/questions/find-leaves-of-binary-tree)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://interviewing.io/questions/count-complete-tree-nodes)\n\n[Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of nodes in the tree.](https://interviewing.io/questions/count-complete-tree-nodes)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Number of Islands](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands)\n\n[Given a 2D matrix, where \"1\" represents land and \"0\" represents water, count how many islands are present.](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Boundary of Binary Tree](https://interviewing.io/questions/boundary-of-binary-tree)\n\n[The boundary of a binary tree is the concatenation of the root, the left boundary, the leaves ordered from left-to-right, and the reverse order of the right boundary.](https://interviewing.io/questions/boundary-of-binary-tree)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Currency Conversion](https://interviewing.io/questions/currency-conversion)\n\n[Given a set of parameters, find the conversion rate that maps to the 'from' currency to the 'to' currency from every single query.

          "content": "### Recursive DFS\n\nDFS is typically implemented with [recursion](https://interviewing.io/recursion-interview-questions)\n, which works naturally with the recursive structure of a graph. We define a function that takes a node as an argument, which handles doing work on the current node (eg. printing the value) and initiating subsequent recursive calls on its children. Note that in some implementations, we will also use a set to track already visited nodes - this is important if we don't know if the graph is acyclic, otherwise we'll cause an infinite loop.\n\nHere are the algorithm steps:\n\n1.  Create a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n2.  Define a recursive function (`dfs`) that takes the current `Node` as a parameter.\n3.  Mark the current node as visited by adding it to the `visited` set.\n4.  Process the current node. This could involve performing any desired operations on the node or checking if it matches some search criteria.\n5.  Iterate through the `neighbors` of the current node. For each unvisited neighbor, recursively call the `dfs` function with that neighbor as the argument.\n6.  Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all unvisited neighbors until there are no more unvisited neighbors or the search criteria are met.\n\nImagine we have a graph with the following node structure:\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, id):\n            self._id = id\n            self._neighbors = []\n    \n\n    1class Node:\n    2    def __init__(self, id):\n    3        self._id = id\n    4        self._neighbors = []\n    5\n\nDFS will recursively call itself on each neighbor of the node. Below, we implement the algorithm using this adjacency list graph, but the same idea would apply for graphs represented using an adjacency matrix or a Von Neumann neighborhood. The neighbor retrieval would only be different.\n\nAdditionally, changing the order in which we iterate over the neighbors will also change the ultimate traversal order. This is especially important when dealing with [binary search trees](https://interviewing.io/binary-trees-interview-questions#what-is-a-bst)\n, where the nodes are sorted in some way.\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    class Graph:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.visited = set()\n    \n        def dfs(self, node):\n            # Mark the current node as visited\n            self.visited.add(node)\n    \n            # Process the current node\n            print(node)\n    \n            # Iterate through neighbors\n            for neighbor in node._neighbors:\n                if neighbor not in self.visited:\n                    # Recursive call with unvisited neighbors\n                    self.dfs(neighbor)\n    \n    # Create a Graph object\n    g = Graph()\n    # Assuming that startNode is already defined\n    g.dfs(startNode)\n    \n\n    1class Graph:\n    2    def __init__(self):\n    3        self.visited = set()\n    4\n    5    def dfs(self, node):\n    6        # Mark the current node as visited\n    7        self.visited.add(node)\n    8\n    9        # Process the current node\n    10        print(node)\n    11\n    12        # Iterate through neighbors\n    13        for neighbor in node._neighbors:\n    14            if neighbor not in self.visited:\n    15                # Recursive call with unvisited neighbors\n    16                self.dfs(neighbor)\n    17\n    18# Create a Graph object\n    19g = Graph()\n    20# Assuming that startNode is already defined\n    21g.dfs(startNode)\n    22\n\nWe begin the traversal by passing the root in as an argument. The function calls itself by passing in the current node's neighbors as arguments for subsequent calls, and a new instance of the function is instantiated as a new frame on the call stack.\n\n![Diagram illustrating how the call stack keeps track of the path taken by a recursive DFS traversal](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dfs_call_stack_747a143bc8.png)\n\nBy using a recursive function, the algorithm keeps track of the nodes that need to be visited with the use of the call stack.

          "content": "### Iterative DFS\n\nAlthough the structure of graphs lend themselves to recursive algorithms, this does not mean that one cannot also use iteration to traverse. Recursion is used in order to take advantage of the call stack - but we can also implement a stack of our own, removing the need for recursion.\n\nIterative approaches to DFS traversal involve using a loop and a stack for traversal. Using a while loop to iterate, a stack can be used to keep track of the nodes that still need to be visited, ensuring that the most recently added nodes, the closest parents, are visited first. This approach allows for efficient traversal of the tree and requires slightly less memory than recursive approaches, albeit no asymptotic change occurs.\n\nPythonJavaC++\n\n    class Graph:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.visited = set()\n    \n        def dfs(self, node):\n            stack = [node]\n    \n            while stack:\n                # Pop the top node from the stack\n                current_node = stack.pop()\n    \n                if current_node not in self.visited:\n                    # Mark the current node as visited\n                    self.visited.add(current_node)\n    \n                    # Process the current node\n                    print(current_node)\n    \n                    for neighbor in current_node._neighbors:\n                        # Push unvisited neighbors onto the stack\n                        stack.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # Create a Graph object\n    g = Graph()\n    # Assuming that startNode is already defined\n    g.dfs(startNode)\n    \n\n    1class Graph:\n    2    def __init__(self):\n    3        self.visited = set()\n    4\n    5    def dfs(self, node):\n    6        stack = [node]\n    7\n    8        while stack:\n    9            # Pop the top node from the stack\n    10            current_node = stack.pop()\n    11\n    12            if current_node not in self.visited:\n    13                # Mark the current node as visited\n    14                self.visited.add(current_node)\n    15\n    16                # Process the current node\n    17                print(current_node)\n    18\n    19                for neighbor in current_node._neighbors:\n    20                    # Push unvisited neighbors onto the stack\n    21                    stack.append(neighbor)\n    22\n    23# Create a Graph object\n    24g = Graph()\n    25# Assuming that startNode is already defined\n    26g.dfs(startNode)\n    27\n\n#### Time and Space Complexity\n\nTime complexity: `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges, as it must process each vertex and each edge exactly once. Space complexity: `O(V`), where `V` is the number of vertices, as it requires a position in the stack for each vertex.\n\nWhen to Use DFS in Technical Interviews\n---------------------------------------\n\nRecall that in an acyclic graph, or a tree, all traversal algorithms will visit each node at least once, so for many problems that require basic search, both DFS and BFS will suffice. But there are certain problems where DFS is preferable:\n\n*   **DFS is particularly useful for backtracking algorithms**: When we need to explore all possible paths, and reverse course when a leaf node or some other condition is met, DFS allows for a convenient way to analyze various paths. Examples of problems like this are those where we are calculating the path sum - adding together the values of the nodes - either searching for the max or optimal sum.\n*   **When there could be an opportunity to cache duplicate operations**: If you're dealing with a graph or a tree that might include overlapping subproblems, you'll want to implement your traversal with DFS so it's easy to cache or memoize the sub-solutions. A classic example of a memoization use-case is when solving fibonacci with recursion - this algorithm effectively imagines the fibonacci resolution as a decision tree which is traversed with a DFS-like recursive algorithm.\n*   **If there is an exponential branching factor**: Memoized DFS is also important to consider if the branching factor of the recursion is exponential, as the volume of computations could be costly.\n*   **In most cases, DFS is slightly more memory efficient than BFS, (though not always)**: This is worth mentioning if you're in a situation where both algorithms are applicable. In a tree, the space usage for DFS is defined as `O(height)`, where height is effectively the number of levels in the tree. BFS, on the other hand, uses `O(branching factor ^ height)`, where `branching factor` is the max or average number of children per node. As such, if `height < branchingFactor ^ height`, then DFS is more space efficient. This is rarely not the case. The absolute time complexity is unlikely to change here though, so the difference in an asymptotic sense is negligible.\n\nCommon Mistakes in Interviews Featuring DFS\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Misunderstanding the tradeoffs and benefits between DFS and BFS**: Remember that in many cases both will do just fine, with little to no tradeoffs, but there are specific cases when we should use BFS (finding the shortest distance between two nodes, for example).\n*   **Not using the correct supporting data structure**: BFS is made possible with a queue data structure, while DFS relies on a stack. It's important to be able to identify this when implementing, and to be sure not to use the wrong supporting data structure.\n*   **Forgetting to track visited nodes**: When dealing with a graph that is not guaranteed to be directed and acyclic, it is essential to track visited nodes in order to avoid an infinite loop. Interviewers will be looking for this as a common pitfall. One way to ensure you don't forget is to perform a manual dry-run of your algorithm.\n*   **Choosing BFS over DFS when it's not needed**: Although in many cases these are both interchangeable, one big benefit of using DFS for backtracking algorithms is that memoization can be implemented easily.\n\nCommon Depth-First Search (DFS) interview Questions\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nMEDIUM",

This structure can represent any binary relationship, making it highly versatile and adaptable to various contexts.\n\nEach node in a graph can hold data and maintain connections to other nodes, signifying the edges. Unlike other data structures such as trees which impose how data can be linked (one direction parent-to-children relationships), graphs do not necessarily impose any restrictions, offering a more general data structure. There's no hierarchy or limit to the number of connections a node can have, and the connections can be either directed, signifying a one-way link, or undirected, indicating a two-way relationship.\n\n![Social Media Is A Graph](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_img_d2e7d813f9.jpeg)\n\nSocial Media Is A Graph (image credit: https://dev.to/tamerlang/data-structures-graphs-2960)\n\nThe abstraction of a graph allows for the application of the same algorithms across diverse scenarios. For instance, in the realm of networking, graphs facilitate the analysis and optimization of transportation, computer, and communication networks by representing cities as nodes and highways as edges. Similarly, in social networks, individuals are depicted as nodes, and their friendships as edges. This versatility extends to computer networks where computers or routers are nodes, and cables form the edges.\n\nFurthermore, graphs play a significant role in various domains of computer science and software engineering. They are instrumental in modeling social behaviors, driving recommendation systems, and enabling graph-based machine learning. In bioinformatics, graphs are utilized to illustrate genetic relationships, underscoring their wide-ranging applications. When you think about some of the biggest tech companies today, you'll see how they solve large scale problems that can fundamentally be thought of as graph problems.\n\n| **Company** | **Use of Graphs** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Uber** | Uses graphs to route drivers to their destinations. The nodes represent locations and the edges represent possible paths between locations. |\n| **Google** | Google's search engine uses graphs to connect users to webpages. The PageRank algorithm, which is based on graph theory, helps determine the importance of different webpages. |\n| **Facebook** | Uses graphs to represent social networks. Each user is a node and each friendship is an edge. This graph is used for features like \"People You May Know\". |\n| **LinkedIn** | Uses graphs for their \"People You May Know\" feature and job recommendations. The nodes represent users and companies, and the edges represent connections and job applications. |\n| **Twitter** | Uses graphs to represent follower relationships. Each user is a node and each follow is an edge. This graph is used for features like \"Who to Follow\". |\n| **Amazon** | Uses graphs for their recommendation system. The nodes represent users and products, and the edges represent purchases and product views. |\n| **Netflix** | Uses graphs for their movie recommendation system. The nodes represent users and movies, and the edges represent user ratings. |\n\n### Graph Terminology\n\nGraph theory itself can be an entire class, but don't think you need stuffy college lectures to be good enough to pass a technical interview. There are a handful of commonly used terms you should be aware of and once you internalize these five bullet points you should be ready for almost any problem thrown at you!\n\nAs mentioned above, **nodes** are also sometimes called **vertices**.\n\n![A node is also called a vertex](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/node_or_vertex_ba8485faf6.jpg)\n\nEdges can be either **directed** or **undirected**. The former indicates a one-way relationship from a particular node to vertex, whereas the latter indicates the edge as bi-directional.\n\n![Edges can be undirected or directed](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/undirected_and_directed_c8bbbdedd5.jpg)\n\nTwo nodes are **adjacent** (aka **neighbors**) if an edge connects them together. And a **path** is a particular permutation of edges in the graph.\n\n![Adjacent nodes are called neighbors and a sequence of edges is known as a path](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/neighbors_and_paths_5d11c2cd99.jpg)\n\nGraphs sometimes can have loops in them. If the graph contains a loop, we call the loop a **cycle** and if it has no loops it is known as **acyclic**.\n\n![Graphs that have loops are called cyclic and graphs without loops are acyclic](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cyclic_and_acyclic_2034f0dcae.jpg)\n\nUsually in more complicated graph problems, we might see **weights** assigned to our edges to illustrate different costs associated with traveling along a particular edge. In the example below, it costs more to travel from node _**a**_ to node _**c**_ if we go directly to it (a total cost of 100), but it is much cheaper to go through node _**b**_ and node _**d**_ and still reach the same destination (for a cost of just 45). Weights are especially useful in _path finding algorithms_.\n\n![Edges in graphs can have weights associated with them](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/weighted_edges_de3083c442.jpg)\n\nFinally, **degree** is a term that comes up in the time and space complexity analysis of graph algorithms. The degree simply refers to the number of edges that are attached to a particular node and is expressed in the form _deg(V)_. Because this is node-specific terminology, the degree can change in the same graph depending on what node we are referring to. Occasionally we will need to know what the overall degree of a graph is, which can be expressed as the average degree – this is just what it sounds like, averaging out the degree across nodes and usually written as _avg deg(V)_. In a binary tree, for instance, we can have 0, 1, or 2 edges attached to any node. The worst case degree of the tree is 2 since the worst case is that the tree is **complete** and contains a maximum of two children at every level except at the final terminal level.\n\n![A degree represents the number of children coming out of a particular node](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/binary_tree_degree_d8d32c9f92.jpg)\n\nUnlike in a binary tree, in graphs, we can have an arbitrary number of edges attached to a given node, so the degree can vary wildly depending on which node we are talking about in the graph.\n\n![Graphs also have degrees](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphs_degree_7cdbae5535.jpg)\n\nThere exist many other terms for graphs, but these terms tend to be more academic and less applicable to interview questions. If you have extra time in your interview prep you might consider also studying:\n\n*   **Connected** and **disconnected** graphs along with the related idea of **connected components**\n*   **Sparse** and **dense** graphs\n*   **In-degree** and **out-degrees** of graphs\n*   Big-O notation of graphs, specifically in relation to their vertices and edges\n\n#### Graph Math\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with graph nomenclature, you might be frightened by how some Computer Science egg-heads chose to represent graphs… mathematically. 🙄\n\nYou'll typically see mathematical notations representing graphs that look something like this…\n\n*   _G = (V, E)_\n*   _V = {a,b,c,d}_\n*   _E = {{a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {b, d}, {c, d}}_\n\nIn the paragraphs above, we have already learned everything we need to know to understand this jargon. The first bullet point simply states that a **G**raph is composed of **V**ertices and **E**dges. The second bullet denotes the **V**ertices in the graph are labeled _**a, b, c**_, and _**d**_. The last bullet describes the **E**dges that exist in the graph. In this case vertex _**a**_ connects to vertex _**b**_, _**a**_ connects to _**c**_, etc. If we were to visualize this graph described above, it would look like this:\n\n![Graph That Was Expressed Mathematically](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_4098952628.jpg)\n\n### Different Graph Representations\n\nSo we now understand why graphs are important and many of the key terms associated with them. You've probably seen trees in the past and how they are represented, but how are graphs represented in code? Trees are hierarchical by definition and have the root as an obvious starting point for doing graph problems. Graphs differ from trees in that they don't have an obvious place to start an algorithm. There is no \"beginning\" node to work from. As a result, all the nodes in a graph are often assigned a key and listed in a data structure that allows for random access and for tracking the connections between nodes. The \"real\" data stored in a node is often mapped to an additional object based on the vertex key.\n\nLet's look at a couple of ways that the below graph can be represented in code.\n\n![Starting Graph To Explore Different Representations](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representations_start_1918867a49.jpg)\n\n#### Edge List\n\nThis is one of the most common ways you will be given a graph in an interview question. You can describe a graph completely by listing out the edges associated with the graph. If you have all the edges, then you can logically understand how the graph is connected together.\n\n![Graph Represented As An Undirected Edge List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_edge_list_undirected_892ec052fe.png)\n\nNotice by default we assume that the graph is undirected. This is an assumption you should always clarify with your interviewer. For instance, they could tell you that the exact same edge list is a **directed** edge list with node-neighbor relationships. We read the relationship from left-to-right, i.e. for (x, y) node x is directly connected to node y. Graphically, that same edge list would represent a slightly more precise graph with directions like the one below.\n\n![Graph Represented As Directed Edge List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_edge_list_directed_be3de530ec.png)\n\n**Real problem example:** A good interview problem example with a directed edge list would be the [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)\n problem.\n\n#### Objects & References\n\nIf you come from an Object-Oriented background, it may feel natural to represent a graph as objects and then lists of references to other objects. You can make a node class, store node data in that class, and then store a list of references to other nodes that are neighbors to that node. While this may seem natural, storing graphs as nodes and list references has a lot of data overhead associated with it and we will learn better methods to represent graphs below. However, this costly graph representation does show up occasionally in interviews, so it is still worth mentioning:\n\n![Graph Represented As Objects & References](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_objects_and_references_706c4b1efb.png)\n\n**Real problem example:** [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)\n\n#### Adjacency List\n\nBy far the most common way to use a graph is to make an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a way of representing a graph using an [array](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions)\n or some key-value store. Key-value data structures are called by different names in each language, so be sure to get familiar with your language's version of the data structure which could be a Map, Dictionary, HashMap or even just a plain object. See the [Hash Table](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n guide for more details on this!\n\nAn adjacency list is a list of vertices with references to the edges of each vertex. We can enumerate the nodes as keys in an object (or as indices in an array) and set the value to each key as a list of associated edges. This allows us to easily find all the nodes that any given node connects to, which makes accessing connected nodes fast. If we were trying to see all nodes that were connected to node A using an edge list, it would take linear time to the number of vertices in the graph. An adjacency list lets us access the connected neighbors in constant time.\n\nAn example adjacency list in python can be seen below using a dictionary where the node is stored as the key and the neighbors for the node are stored as the values for the key. For additional speed, you can store values in the hash table as sets instead of lists assuming order does not matter and duplicates are not possible. This allows you to additionally ask questions like \"does node X have node Y as a neighbor\" in constant time. The below example just stores values in a python list.\n\n![Graph Represented As A Key-Based Adjacency List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_adjacency_list_key_based_7626e61400.png)\n\nAnother common way to represent an adjacency list is just as a list of lists. The first element in the list represents the first node, the second element represents the second node and so on. Here's what that would look like:\n\n![Graph Represented As An Index-Based Adjacency List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_adjacency_list_index_based_5e7ba95c91.png)\n\n**Real problem example:** [Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/)\n\n#### Adjacency Matrix\n\nAn adjacency matrix is similar to our adjacency list except that it explicitly defines every possible edge in the graph. Using a 2D matrix of size `O(V * V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices in the graph, each cell in the matrix represents an edge between vertex one (the row) and vertex two (the column).\n\nRather than only tracking the edges that do exist, an adjacency matrix is a boolean matrix that contains every possible edge and tells us either 1 (it exists) or 0 (it does not exist). Checking for the existence of an edge between two vertices can be done in `O(1)` (constant) time since we can index directly into `adj_matrix[v1][v2]`.\n\n![Graph Represented As An Adjacency Matrix](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_adjacency_matrix_3fae8cc623.png)\n\nThis is arguably one of the most confusing graph representations to look at, so if this is confusing to you, check out a more detailed explanation of 2D matrices in Arrays! Don't stress because this graph representation type is generally uncommon to occur in real interviews for reasons outlined below.\n\n**Real problem example:** [Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/description/)\n\n#### 2D Matrix\n\nThe last and arguably most common way graphs are represented in interview questions are through 2D matrices (nested lists). This differs from the adjacency matrix mentioned above, because the adjacency matrix specifically iterates all possible connections between all possible vertices whereas 2D matrices on their own express edges by their location relative to one another. Conceptually, there is nothing special about 2D matrix graphs.\n\n![Graph Represented As A 2D Matrix](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_2d_matrix_12f9790a08.png)\n\n**Real problem example:** [Count Islands](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands)\n\n#### Best Graph Representation\n\nAfter looking at this list, you may question which graph representation is \"best\", but the truth is that it just depends on how we plan to reference the data structure in our code. In most interview problems, you'll find that an adjacency list tends to be a preferred for a few reasons: 1) it is more compact for sparse graphs and 2) if a node has a small degree, it is much faster to iterate through its neighbors. In contrast, the main advantage of the adjacency matrix is being able to check if two nodes are adjacent in constant time. Sometimes, it even makes sense to use both in the same algorithm, but usually not in coding interviews.\n\n|     | **Edge List** | **Objects & References** | **Adjacency List** | **Adjacency Matrix** | **2D Grid as a Graph** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Pros** | Simple to implement. Good for sparse graphs. | Intuitive, especially for object-oriented programming. Good for representing complex data. | Efficient for many operations. Good for sparse graphs. | Very efficient for checking if an edge exists between two nodes. Good for dense graphs. | Intuitive for grid-based problems. Easy to calculate neighbors. |\n| **Cons** | Inefficient for many operations, such as checking if an edge exists between two nodes. | Can be memory-intensive. Not as straightforward for certain algorithms. | Not as efficient for dense graphs. | Can be memory-intensive, especially for large, sparse graphs. | Only suitable for grid-based problems. Not as flexible as other representations. |\n| **Space Complexity** | `O(E)` | `O(V + E)` | `O(V + E)` | `O(V^2)` | `O(R * C)` |\n| **Insert Node** | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | `O(V^2)` | N/A |\n| **Insert Edge** | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | N/A |\n| **Remove Node** | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(V^2)` | N/A |\n| **Remove Edge** | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(1)` | N/A |\n| **Check If v1 & v2 are Adjacent** | `O(E)` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` |\n| **Iterate v1's Neighbors** | `O(E)` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(V)` | `O(1)` |\n| **Check If Edge Exists** | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` |\n\nV = # of vertices (nodes), E = # of edges, deg(V) = degree of a vertex  \nR = # of rows in grid, C = # of columns in grid\n\nNote that these complexities are average cases and can vary based on the specific implementation and the nature of the graph. Operations for the 2D grid are not applicable in the traditional sense because nodes and edges don't have the same meaning in a grid problem and it is more common to express complexities in terms of the number of **R**ows and **C**olumns in the grid.\n\nCompanies That Ask Graph Questions\n----------------------------------\n\n[![Google](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgoogle_com_128x128_2818837343.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Google](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/google)\n\n[Watch 40  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=google)\n\n[![Meta](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fmeta_com_128x128_b410083a0c.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook)\n\n[Meta](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook)\n\n[Watch 27  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=meta)\n\n[![Amazon](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Famazon_128x128_15213fbc98.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Amazon](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon)\n\n[Watch 31  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=amazon)\n\n[![Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fmicrosoft_com_128x128_e8c2de6d0b.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Microsoft](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft)\n\n[Watch 24  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=microsoft)\n\n[![Netflix](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fnetflix_com_128x128_6507a7127a.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix)\n\n[Netflix](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/netflix)\n\n[Watch 2  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=netflix)\n\n[![Apple](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fapple_com_128x128_61116200e1.png&w=128&q=75)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Apple](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Interview process  \\\n& questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/apple)\n\n[Watch 3  \\\ninterview replays](https://interviewing.io/mocks?company=apple)\n\nWhen to Use Graphs in Interviews\n--------------------------------\n\nGraphs are used for representing relationships between data - so graph algorithms most frequently come up in those contexts. Oftentimes graphs are used in coding interviews to compute something that isn’t explicitly in a graph.\n\nFor example, you might see a problem that asks you to find the path between node A and node B. Or you might have to come up with the correct series of moves to solve some sort of game. Even though the problem might not directly frame itself as such, these are both graph problems. If you are playing chess, you have the current game state on the chess board. Visualizing the board as a graph (usually a 2D matrix) makes it easier to solve these problems.\n\nCommon examples of problems involving graphs include:\n\n| **Problem Type** | **Example** | **Notes** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Board games / puzzle games | Sudoku, Chess, Go, Mazes, N-Queens, etc | Usually represented as a 2D matrix |\n| Dependency problems (aka topological sort problems) | Course scheduling, task scheduling, todo scheduling, etc | Tends to be given in the form of an edge list or an adjacency list |\n| Connectivity | Island count in a grid, Number of provinces | Can be represented in various ways. Depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) are commonly used. |\n| Shortest path problems | Minimum moves to get Knight from point A to B, shortest path from A to B, etc | Graph representation varies for these problems, but the optimal traversal choice tends to be a BFS. Advanced options include Dijkstra's algorithm or (rarely) Bellman-Ford. |\n| Route based problems | Getting from point A to B (not necessarily the shortest path) | Graph representation varies for these problems, but these algorithms tend to be difficult to optimize and usually end up being a DFS + Backtracking combo |\n| Cycle detection | Detecting a cycle in a linked list, Finding a cycle in a directed graph | Can be represented in various ways. Depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) are commonly used. |\n| Network flow | Maximum flow, Minimum Cut | Typically represented as an adjacency matrix. Often involve weighted edges. |\n\nCommon Mistakes in Interviews Featuring Graphs\n----------------------------------------------\n\n### Not Using (Or Misusing) a Visited Locations Data Structure\n\nHands down the most common mistake in graph questions is for a candidate to forget entirely or just misuse the visited locations data structure in a graph traversal. This data structure (usually represented as a 2D matrix or a hash table) keeps track of the nodes we have already visited in our graph traversal.\n\nWe use this data structure in both a [BFS](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n and [DFS](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n, yet it is incredibly common for candidates to entirely forget to track visited locations, forget to add newly visited locations to their visited data structure, and/or forget to check their visited locations before exploring a new location.\n\nA final common mistake with this data structure is passing it around when making function calls. Candidates tend to accidentally create copies of a path that is not changing, leading to an ever-growing complexity in graph exploration. The key here is to use the same variable across all function calls unless the problem truly requires each path to have its own visited data structure.\n\nAny of these rookie mistakes will result in an infinite loop and will likely lead to a rejection. This is so common that Googlers have internal memes about this mistake, so definitely don't make this mistake in your interview!\n\n### Coding Helper Functions Instead of the Main Algorithm\n\nIn most graph problems (especially board game/puzzle problems), you'll need helper methods to help you solve the problem. In the N-Queens problem, you'll need a helper function to check if a queen at a current row and column is under attack. In Sudoku you might need a helper function that determines if the current cell already has the chosen number in the row, column or surrounding area. These types of helper functions are considered \"fluff\" in the problem.\n\nThe mistake is that many people get bogged down in coding these helper functions first and wind up with a half working helper function and no main algorithm. At this point the interviewer is forced to give you a rejection because they don't know if you can code the algorithm or not because all the time was wasted on the meaningless helper function.\n\nFocus on the algorithm and show you can code that. If you show that you can code the recursive backtracking DFS to solve the problem, then even if you don't have time to implement the helper functions you proposed the interviewer will know you're capable of it because you tackled the hardest part of the question first. Liberally define helper functions and leave them unimplemented until you're done solving the main parts of the algorithm.\n\n### Not Seeing the Problem as a Graph Problem\n\nThe infamous [Alien Dictionary](https://interviewing.io/questions/alien-dictionary)\n problem is a classic example of a problem where it is not intuitive at first glance that the problem is a graph problem. Be aware that sometimes it will take some critical thinking before realizing a problem can be thought of as a graph. For this particular problem, it takes lots of thought to construct rules that turn into dependencies in the form of an edge list and eventually give enough information to construct a graph.\n\n### Not Asking About the Characteristics of the Graph\n\n*   Can the graph have **cycles**?\n*   Is the graph **directed** or **undirected**?\n*   Is it possible that the graph is **disconnected**?\n*   Is the graph **sparse** or **dense**?\n\nWhat to Say in Interviews to Show Mastery Over Graphs\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Discuss Graph Representation\n\nSometimes we are given a graph in a \"bad format\" like an edge list and we will need to transform it into a different graph representation to solve the problem efficiently. In these circumstances, it's worthwhile to pause and discuss what graph representation you will choose. It's the sign of a senior engineer that discusses different ways to build the graph in these types of problems rather than just jumping into a single graph representation because that is what they are familiar with.\n\n### Discuss The Algorithm\n\nThe benefit to graph problems is that you wind up coding, one of two algorithms in 80% of all of the problems. These two graph algorithms are depth first search and breadth first search. Get comfortable with both! Before diving in and coding, discuss the trade-offs associated with each. In many problems either algorithm can work. Show mastery of the topic by briefly proposing both options and thoughtfully choosing one. When there is no obvious chose and either one seems appropriate, still give a justification for why you're coding the algorithm you've chosen, i.e. \"It looks like either could work, but I'm going to go with a recursive DFS since it is easy to follow, easy to code, and easy to maintain.\"\n\nOccasionally, in the remaining 20% of graph problems we might need a more niche algorithm to get the job done. The next most important algorithms to learn – in order – include:\n\n*   Topological sort (for those dependency problems!)\n*   Dijkstra's algorithm (when BFS isn't enough and we don't have negative edge weights)\n*   Union-Find (for the 1% of problems that can't use DFS instead)\n\nHere at interviewing.io, we generally recommend _avoiding_ spending time on more complicated algorithms including Bellman-Ford, A\\*, Prim's, etc. While some questions on leetcode do require an understanding of these algorithms, they are too niche for a general SWE to be expected to know off hand. Keep in mind you likely _**will**_ need to know these algorithms if you are applying for a position that has graph theory requirements attached to it or if you have a background in graphs (like you have a graduate degree in graph theory, for instance).\n\nCommon Graph interview Questions\n--------------------------------\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Container With the Most Water](https://interviewing.io/questions/container-with-most-water)\n\n[Given n non-negative integers, find two lines that form a container that can hold the most amount of water.](https://interviewing.io/questions/container-with-most-water)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Right View Of Binary Tree](https://interviewing.io/questions/right-view-of-binary-tree)\n\n[Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.](https://interviewing.io/questions/right-view-of-binary-tree)\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms\n\n### [Currency Conversion](https://interviewing.io/questions/currency-conversion)\n\n[Given a set of parameters, find the conversion rate that maps to the 'from' currency to the 'to' currency from every single query.

          "content": "### Graph Terminology\n\nGraph theory itself can be an entire class, but don't think you need stuffy college lectures to be good enough to pass a technical interview. There are a handful of commonly used terms you should be aware of and once you internalize these five bullet points you should be ready for almost any problem thrown at you!\n\nAs mentioned above, **nodes** are also sometimes called **vertices**.\n\n![A node is also called a vertex](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/node_or_vertex_ba8485faf6.jpg)\n\nEdges can be either **directed** or **undirected**. The former indicates a one-way relationship from a particular node to vertex, whereas the latter indicates the edge as bi-directional.\n\n![Edges can be undirected or directed](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/undirected_and_directed_c8bbbdedd5.jpg)\n\nTwo nodes are **adjacent** (aka **neighbors**) if an edge connects them together. And a **path** is a particular permutation of edges in the graph.\n\n![Adjacent nodes are called neighbors and a sequence of edges is known as a path](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/neighbors_and_paths_5d11c2cd99.jpg)\n\nGraphs sometimes can have loops in them. If the graph contains a loop, we call the loop a **cycle** and if it has no loops it is known as **acyclic**.\n\n![Graphs that have loops are called cyclic and graphs without loops are acyclic](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cyclic_and_acyclic_2034f0dcae.jpg)\n\nUsually in more complicated graph problems, we might see **weights** assigned to our edges to illustrate different costs associated with traveling along a particular edge. In the example below, it costs more to travel from node _**a**_ to node _**c**_ if we go directly to it (a total cost of 100), but it is much cheaper to go through node _**b**_ and node _**d**_ and still reach the same destination (for a cost of just 45). Weights are especially useful in _path finding algorithms_.\n\n![Edges in graphs can have weights associated with them](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/weighted_edges_de3083c442.jpg)\n\nFinally, **degree** is a term that comes up in the time and space complexity analysis of graph algorithms. The degree simply refers to the number of edges that are attached to a particular node and is expressed in the form _deg(V)_. Because this is node-specific terminology, the degree can change in the same graph depending on what node we are referring to. Occasionally we will need to know what the overall degree of a graph is, which can be expressed as the average degree – this is just what it sounds like, averaging out the degree across nodes and usually written as _avg deg(V)_. In a binary tree, for instance, we can have 0, 1, or 2 edges attached to any node. The worst case degree of the tree is 2 since the worst case is that the tree is **complete** and contains a maximum of two children at every level except at the final terminal level.\n\n![A degree represents the number of children coming out of a particular node](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/binary_tree_degree_d8d32c9f92.jpg)\n\nUnlike in a binary tree, in graphs, we can have an arbitrary number of edges attached to a given node, so the degree can vary wildly depending on which node we are talking about in the graph.\n\n![Graphs also have degrees](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphs_degree_7cdbae5535.jpg)\n\nThere exist many other terms for graphs, but these terms tend to be more academic and less applicable to interview questions. If you have extra time in your interview prep you might consider also studying:\n\n*   **Connected** and **disconnected** graphs along with the related idea of **connected components**\n*   **Sparse** and **dense** graphs\n*   **In-degree** and **out-degrees** of graphs\n*   Big-O notation of graphs, specifically in relation to their vertices and edges\n\n#### Graph Math\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with graph nomenclature, you might be frightened by how some Computer Science egg-heads chose to represent graphs… mathematically. 🙄\n\nYou'll typically see mathematical notations representing graphs that look something like this…\n\n*   _G = (V, E)_\n*   _V = {a,b,c,d}_\n*   _E = {{a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {b, d}, {c, d}}_\n\nIn the paragraphs above, we have already learned everything we need to know to understand this jargon. The first bullet point simply states that a **G**raph is composed of **V**ertices and **E**dges. The second bullet denotes the **V**ertices in the graph are labeled _**a, b, c**_, and _**d**_. The last bullet describes the **E**dges that exist in the graph. In this case vertex _**a**_ connects to vertex _**b**_, _**a**_ connects to _**c**_, etc. If we were to visualize this graph described above, it would look like this:\n\n![Graph That Was Expressed Mathematically](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_4098952628.jpg)",

          "content": "### Different Graph Representations So we now understand why graphs are important and many of the key terms associated with them. You've probably seen trees in the past and how they are represented, but how are graphs represented in code? Trees are hierarchical by definition and have the root as an obvious starting point for doing graph problems. Graphs differ from trees in that they don't have an obvious place to start an algorithm. There is no \"beginning\" node to work from. As a result, all the nodes in a graph are often assigned a key and listed in a data structure that allows for random access and for tracking the connections between nodes. The \"real\" data stored in a node is often mapped to an additional object based on the vertex key. Let's look at a couple of ways that the below graph can be represented in code. ![Starting Graph To Explore Different Representations](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representations_start_1918867a49.jpg) #### Edge List This is one of the most common ways you will be given a graph in an interview question. You can describe a graph completely by listing out the edges associated with the graph. If you have all the edges, then you can logically understand how the graph is connected together. ![Graph Represented As An Undirected Edge List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_edge_list_undirected_892ec052fe.png) Notice by default we assume that the graph is undirected. This is an assumption you should always clarify with your interviewer. For instance, they could tell you that the exact same edge list is a **directed** edge list with node-neighbor relationships. We read the relationship from left-to-right, i.e. for (x, y) node x is directly connected to node y. Graphically, that same edge list would represent a slightly more precise graph with directions like the one below. ![Graph Represented As Directed Edge List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_edge_list_directed_be3de530ec.png) **Real problem example:** A good interview problem example with a directed edge list would be the [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/) problem. #### Objects & References If you come from an Object-Oriented background, it may feel natural to represent a graph as objects and then lists of references to other objects. You can make a node class, store node data in that class, and then store a list of references to other nodes that are neighbors to that node. While this may seem natural, storing graphs as nodes and list references has a lot of data overhead associated with it and we will learn better methods to represent graphs below. However, this costly graph representation does show up occasionally in interviews, so it is still worth mentioning: ![Graph Represented As Objects & References](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_objects_and_references_706c4b1efb.png) **Real problem example:** [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/) #### Adjacency List By far the most common way to use a graph is to make an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a way of representing a graph using an [array](https://interviewing.io/arrays-interview-questions) or some key-value store. Key-value data structures are called by different names in each language, so be sure to get familiar with your language's version of the data structure which could be a Map, Dictionary, HashMap or even just a plain object. See the [Hash Table](https://interviewing.io/hash-tables-interview-questions) guide for more details on this! An adjacency list is a list of vertices with references to the edges of each vertex. We can enumerate the nodes as keys in an object (or as indices in an array) and set the value to each key as a list of associated edges. This allows us to easily find all the nodes that any given node connects to, which makes accessing connected nodes fast. If we were trying to see all nodes that were connected to node A using an edge list, it would take linear time to the number of vertices in the graph. An adjacency list lets us access the connected neighbors in constant time. An example adjacency list in python can be seen below using a dictionary where the node is stored as the key and the neighbors for the node are stored as the values for the key. For additional speed, you can store values in the hash table as sets instead of lists assuming order does not matter and duplicates are not possible. This allows you to additionally ask questions like \"does node X have node Y as a neighbor\" in constant time. The below example just stores values in a python list. ![Graph Represented As A Key-Based Adjacency List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_adjacency_list_key_based_7626e61400.png) Another common way to represent an adjacency list is just as a list of lists. The first element in the list represents the first node, the second element represents the second node and so on. Here's what that would look like: ![Graph Represented As An Index-Based Adjacency List](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_adjacency_list_index_based_5e7ba95c91.png) **Real problem example:** [Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/) #### Adjacency Matrix An adjacency matrix is similar to our adjacency list except that it explicitly defines every possible edge in the graph. Using a 2D matrix of size `O(V * V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices in the graph, each cell in the matrix represents an edge between vertex one (the row) and vertex two (the column). Rather than only tracking the edges that do exist, an adjacency matrix is a boolean matrix that contains every possible edge and tells us either 1 (it exists) or 0 (it does not exist). Checking for the existence of an edge between two vertices can be done in `O(1)` (constant) time since we can index directly into `adj_matrix[v1][v2]`. ![Graph Represented As An Adjacency Matrix](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_adjacency_matrix_3fae8cc623.png) This is arguably one of the most confusing graph representations to look at, so if this is confusing to you, check out a more detailed explanation of 2D matrices in Arrays! Don't stress because this graph representation type is generally uncommon to occur in real interviews for reasons outlined below. **Real problem example:** [Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/description/) #### 2D Matrix The last and arguably most common way graphs are represented in interview questions are through 2D matrices (nested lists).",

This differs from the adjacency matrix mentioned above, because the adjacency matrix specifically iterates all possible connections between all possible vertices whereas 2D matrices on their own express edges by their location relative to one another. Conceptually, there is nothing special about 2D matrix graphs. ![Graph Represented As A 2D Matrix](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graph_representation_2d_matrix_12f9790a08.png) **Real problem example:** [Count Islands](https://interviewing.io/questions/number-of-islands) #### Best Graph Representation After looking at this list, you may question which graph representation is \"best\", but the truth is that it just depends on how we plan to reference the data structure in our code. In most interview problems, you'll find that an adjacency list tends to be a preferred for a few reasons: 1) it is more compact for sparse graphs and 2) if a node has a small degree, it is much faster to iterate through its neighbors. In contrast, the main advantage of the adjacency matrix is being able to check if two nodes are adjacent in constant time. Sometimes, it even makes sense to use both in the same algorithm, but usually not in coding interviews. | | **Edge List** | **Objects & References** | **Adjacency List** | **Adjacency Matrix** | **2D Grid as a Graph** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Pros** | Simple to implement. Good for sparse graphs. | Intuitive, especially for object-oriented programming. Good for representing complex data. | Efficient for many operations. Good for sparse graphs. | Very efficient for checking if an edge exists between two nodes. Good for dense graphs. | Intuitive for grid-based problems. Easy to calculate neighbors. | | **Cons** | Inefficient for many operations, such as checking if an edge exists between two nodes. | Can be memory-intensive. Not as straightforward for certain algorithms. | Not as efficient for dense graphs. | Can be memory-intensive, especially for large, sparse graphs. | Only suitable for grid-based problems. Not as flexible as other representations. | | **Space Complexity** | `O(E)` | `O(V + E)` | `O(V + E)` | `O(V^2)` | `O(R * C)` | | **Insert Node** | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | `O(V^2)` | N/A | | **Insert Edge** | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | N/A | | **Remove Node** | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(V^2)` | N/A | | **Remove Edge** | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(1)` | N/A | | **Check If v1 & v2 are Adjacent** | `O(E)` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | | **Iterate v1's Neighbors** | `O(E)` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(V)` | `O(1)` | | **Check If Edge Exists** | `O(E)` | `O(E)` | `O(deg(V))` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | V = # of vertices (nodes), E = # of edges, deg(V) = degree of a vertex R = # of rows in grid, C = # of columns in grid Note that these complexities are average cases and can vary based on the specific implementation and the nature of the graph. Operations for the 2D grid are not applicable in the traditional sense because nodes and edges don't have the same meaning in a grid problem and it is more common to express complexities in terms of the number of **R**ows and **C**olumns in the grid.

Oftentimes graphs are used in coding interviews to compute something that isn’t explicitly in a graph. For example, you might see a problem that asks you to find the path between node A and node B. Or you might have to come up with the correct series of moves to solve some sort of game. Even though the problem might not directly frame itself as such, these are both graph problems. If you are playing chess, you have the current game state on the chess board. Visualizing the board as a graph (usually a 2D matrix) makes it easier to solve these problems. Common examples of problems involving graphs include: | **Problem Type** | **Example** | **Notes** | | --- | --- | --- | | Board games / puzzle games | Sudoku, Chess, Go, Mazes, N-Queens, etc | Usually represented as a 2D matrix | | Dependency problems (aka topological sort problems) | Course scheduling, task scheduling, todo scheduling, etc | Tends to be given in the form of an edge list or an adjacency list | | Connectivity | Island count in a grid, Number of provinces | Can be represented in various ways. Depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) are commonly used. | | Shortest path problems | Minimum moves to get Knight from point A to B, shortest path from A to B, etc | Graph representation varies for these problems, but the optimal traversal choice tends to be a BFS. Advanced options include Dijkstra's algorithm or (rarely) Bellman-Ford.",

This data structure (usually represented as a 2D matrix or a hash table) keeps track of the nodes we have already visited in our graph traversal.\n\nWe use this data structure in both a [BFS](https://interviewing.io/breadth-first-search-interview-questions)\n and [DFS](https://interviewing.io/depth-first-search-interview-questions)\n, yet it is incredibly common for candidates to entirely forget to track visited locations, forget to add newly visited locations to their visited data structure, and/or forget to check their visited locations before exploring a new location.\n\nA final common mistake with this data structure is passing it around when making function calls. Candidates tend to accidentally create copies of a path that is not changing, leading to an ever-growing complexity in graph exploration. The key here is to use the same variable across all function calls unless the problem truly requires each path to have its own visited data structure.\n\nAny of these rookie mistakes will result in an infinite loop and will likely lead to a rejection. This is so common that Googlers have internal memes about this mistake, so definitely don't make this mistake in your interview!",

In the N-Queens problem, you'll need a helper function to check if a queen at a current row and column is under attack. In Sudoku you might need a helper function that determines if the current cell already has the chosen number in the row, column or surrounding area. These types of helper functions are considered \"fluff\" in the problem.\n\nThe mistake is that many people get bogged down in coding these helper functions first and wind up with a half working helper function and no main algorithm. At this point the interviewer is forced to give you a rejection because they don't know if you can code the algorithm or not because all the time was wasted on the meaningless helper function.\n\nFocus on the algorithm and show you can code that. If you show that you can code the recursive backtracking DFS to solve the problem, then even if you don't have time to implement the helper functions you proposed the interviewer will know you're capable of it because you tackled the hardest part of the question first.

          "content": "### Discuss The Algorithm\n\nThe benefit to graph problems is that you wind up coding, one of two algorithms in 80% of all of the problems. These two graph algorithms are depth first search and breadth first search. Get comfortable with both! Before diving in and coding, discuss the trade-offs associated with each. In many problems either algorithm can work. Show mastery of the topic by briefly proposing both options and thoughtfully choosing one. When there is no obvious chose and either one seems appropriate, still give a justification for why you're coding the algorithm you've chosen, i.e. \"It looks like either could work, but I'm going to go with a recursive DFS since it is easy to follow, easy to code, and easy to maintain.\"\n\nOccasionally, in the remaining 20% of graph problems we might need a more niche algorithm to get the job done. The next most important algorithms to learn – in order – include:\n\n*   Topological sort (for those dependency problems!)\n*   Dijkstra's algorithm (when BFS isn't enough and we don't have negative edge weights)\n*   Union-Find (for the 1% of problems that can't use DFS instead)\n\nHere at interviewing.io, we generally recommend _avoiding_ spending time on more complicated algorithms including Bellman-Ford, A\\*, Prim's, etc. While some questions on leetcode do require an understanding of these algorithms, they are too niche for a general SWE to be expected to know off hand. Keep in mind you likely _**will**_ need to know these algorithms if you are applying for a position that has graph theory requirements attached to it or if you have a background in graphs (like you have a graduate degree in graph theory, for instance).\n\nCommon Graph interview Questions\n--------------------------------\n\nMEDIUM\n\nData Structures and Algorithms",
