I'm Shrey, and I'm a software engineer turned travel advisor. Back in March 2020, the travel bug bit me hard at probably the worst possible time. While the rest of the world was in quarantine picking up new hobbies, baking sourdough, and doing TikTok dances, I spent all my free time reading about the one thing I couldn’t do at the time: travel.\n\nOver the past two years, I've traveled hundreds of thousands of miles and redeemed tens of thousands of dollars in free travel. There’s a pervasive myth that traveling the world on points requires seven-figure spending or constantly hopping coast to coast for some big consulting firm. That hasn’t been my experience: I rarely traveled for work as an engineer and I’d like to think I spend frugally, yet I’ve learned to make these credit card and frequent flyer programs work for me.\n\nThere’s no shortage of travel hacking content online, but points are a chaotic, complex web of unintuitive axioms and odd stipulations. I’ve always found that you can’t actually get anywhere without reading dozens of articles, and even then, it feels like you’re trying to clear a forest with a butter knife. In this Substack, my goal is to cut through the noise and clear the path for you. You’ll learn hacks that you can apply **today**, and hopefully over time, you’ll also develop an intuition for hacking on your own too.\n\nToday we’re tackling transfer partners, one of the most important and high impact topics that will show you the path to doing tons of free flights. I imagine people are at very different levels of familiarity with transfer partners, so if you’re new, keep reading, and if you’re a seasoned veteran, feel free to scroll down a bit unless you want a refresher!\n\nFor beginners: Why do Transfer Partners matter?\n\n\n=================================================\n\nIf you’ve seen people zipping around on free business class flights, chances are they’re not just secretly point millionaires. Instead, they’re stretching their credit card points by transferring them into specific airline frequent flyer programs.\n\nThe major credit card programs for travel are Amex, Chase, Citi, Capital One, and Bilt — I’ll call these the Big 5. Most travelers know that the Big 5 programs each have a travel portal where you can easily redeem your points on flights. The catch is this usually involves spending your points at a **fixed rate** of 1-1.5¢/point. That means if you want a $1000 flight, you’re could be burning as much as 100k points — that’s more than most credit card sign up bonuses, just for one flight!\n\nWhat savvy travelers know is the Big 5 also allow you to transfer your points to specific frequent flyer partners, and this is the key to unlocking their true value. This is because unlike the Big 5 travel portals, **most frequent flyer programs don’t set a fixed exchange rate.** This means your points could be worth way more when you transfer! You can routinely find redemptions of 2-3¢/point, and if you’re really skilled or lucky, I’ve seen killer redemptions as high as 12¢/point! That same $1000 flight could cost you as little as 8k points — you might earn that in just a single month of smart spending.\n\n![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F744cffc1-0f00-4a75-b72a-b4858cc6ce64_768x1024.jpeg)![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffab1febf-0c7d-4aef-96b9-5e821af3bdda_768x1024.jpeg)\n\n![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eb15763-d458-4e25-a9d9-3831b422201f_768x1024.jpeg)![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f1cec57-c1ce-49cb-8c28-c04dd12fad29_768x1024.jpeg)\n\nMy free birthday trip last year, sponsored by my points! Also got to enjoy United's Polaris lounges which come with a free table service restaurant.\n\nI could probably write a PhD thesis on transfer partners, but for now I’ll try and give you my best 10 minutes on the topic.\n\nRules of the Game\n\n\n-------------------\n\nGetting high redemptions doesn’t come for free, and it does involve a bit of a learning curve. First, a few ground rules for working with points:\n\n*   _Transfers are one way._ Once you transfer points from a credit card program to a frequent flyer program, you can’t go back. Only transfer if (a) you have a redemption in mind and are about to book or (b) there’s a great transfer bonus (we’ll talk about this in future issues).\n    \n*   _You can’t just transfer to any program._ Each of the big 5 credit card programs partners with _specific_ frequent flyer programs. This is why it’s best to own cards across various programs.\n    \n*   _You usually can’t transfer points across frequent flyer programs._ For example, a mile in United MileagePlus usually can’t be transferred to Air Canada Aeroplan. (There are a few limited exceptions, but I’ll cover those in future issues.)\n    \n*   _Transfers are usually 1:1 but not always._ For example, you can convert 1 Chase point into 1 United mile. While the majority of transfer partners for the Big 5 are 1:1, some have slightly unequal ratios like 1:2 or 2:1.5 for some of the less commonly used partners.\n    \n\nA motivating example: Let’s go to London in the spring!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow for some examples! Let’s say you want to take advantage of the [shoulder season](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/5-reasons-why-shoulder-season-is-the-best-time-to-travel#:~:text=The%20definition%20of%20shoulder%20season,would%20be%20spring%20and%20fall.)\n for London in April — it’s starting to warm up but you’re not paying peak season prices. If you have a Chase Sapphire or Bilt card, you can transfer your credit card points to United MileagePlus and book a United Polaris business class flight departing March 30th from EWR to LHR for 80k miles.\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd30cd8-fa2b-4774-b058-f6e39935af44_2330x610.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Op!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd30cd8-fa2b-4774-b058-f6e39935af44_2330x610.png)\n\nFound on the United Airlines award search tool [here](https://www.united.com/en/us)\n; just select “Pay with Miles”.\n\nThe actual flight would cost $1988 if we bought outright in cash according to Google Flights:\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ac6f930-25b6-449a-9c72-30494114b5a0_2078x490.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ByLq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ac6f930-25b6-449a-9c72-30494114b5a0_2078x490.png)\n\nThat means we’re redeeming our points at a rate of roughly 2.48¢/point!\n\nCompare this the quote of 132487 points we get from the Chase portal:\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe072a43d-aca3-4371-9aa4-d3a6ecf564db_1890x740.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qAg5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe072a43d-aca3-4371-9aa4-d3a6ecf564db_1890x740.png)\n\nSince I have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, my Chase points redeem at a fixed rate of 1.5¢/point in their portal (a signature benefit of that card), but just by transferring into United instead, I squeeze out 65% more value from my points!\n\nIf you want to go far, go together: The magic of airline alliances\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, each of the Big 5 programs has a designated list of transfer partners. Here’s the list for Bilt for example:\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05a0686c-1c48-47ed-b99b-e432805a14a5_4911x814.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!idRU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05a0686c-1c48-47ed-b99b-e432805a14a5_4911x814.png)\n\nIt’s perfectly normal to look at this list and think “I’ve never heard of half of these airlines, let alone flown them.” But you don’t actually need to _fly_ these airlines to get tremendous value out of their frequent flyer programs.\n\nLet me explain. Most airlines are part of a major airline alliance. You’ve probably heard of them:\n\n*   Star Alliance (cofounded by United)\n    \n*   Skyteam (cofounded by Delta)\n    \n*   Oneworld (cofounded by American)\n    \n\nWhen an airline join an alliance, they agree to allow other airlines in the alliance sell tickets on their flights, and in return they get to sell tickets on their partners flights. When you go on the United website and you see an option to buy a ticket that’s actually operated by Turkish Airlines, that’s why — both of them are in Star Alliance.\n\nFortunately for us, this cross-selling phenomenon isn’t just limited to tickets bought in cash (“revenue tickets”, in point hacker parlance). It also applies to tickets bought on points (“award tickets”)! I**n other words, Turkish Airlines can let members of their frequent flyer program, Miles&Smiles, book award tickets on United flights using their Turkish Airlines miles**. Similarly, United MileagePlus members can often book Turkish Airlines flights using their United miles.\n\nThis opens up a whole glorious world of possibilities and points arbitrage. Each frequent flyer program uses a different method to calculate how many points a given flight should cost. Some look at the flight distance, some look at which regions the flight transits between, and others look at how much demand exists for that seat. This means you can sometimes find the **exact same flight and cabin** for fewer points in a partner program!\n\nSo let’s go back to our example: EWR-LHR in business class on flight UA 110. If we check the Turkish Airlines award search, we can find that same exact seat for just 45k Turkish miles. That’s a whopping 4.97¢/point!\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20c5e4ea-5d34-4133-b5d7-3d465130e357_1960x846.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0nNe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20c5e4ea-5d34-4133-b5d7-3d465130e357_1960x846.png)\n\nFound on the Turkish Airlines award search tool [here](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-us/index.html#login?url=http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-us/miles-and-smiles/book-award-tickets/)\n. (You will need to make a Turkish Airlines account to access this.)\n\nIf you’ll recall, this same flight would have cost 80k United miles or just above 130k Chase points — we’ve literally gotten 2-3x the value just by going through a United partner.\n\nYou may think “but wait, I don’t have any Turkish miles.” But if you have a Bilt card (or selected Citi or Capital One cards), your credit card points can transfer at a 1:1 ratio into Turkish Airlines Miles&Smiles. This is why these transferrable points programs are so powerful: you can use them to book flights in programs you don’t regular use.\n\nNow let’s say you _only_ have an Amex. You wouldn’t be able to transfer to Turkish Airlines unfortunately, but there’s still a deal for you! Chances are you’ve never flown or even heard of Avianca, but all you need to know is they’re a Star Alliance partner too. And that same EWR-LHR United business class seat is still available for 60k Avianca Lifemiles. Not as amazing as the Turkish redemption, but still a nice discount from the United MileagePlus one!\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F828ed708-35cf-4bde-a83c-4d66bd455340_3070x502.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vq7N!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F828ed708-35cf-4bde-a83c-4d66bd455340_3070x502.png)\n\nFound on the Avianca Lifemiles award search tool [here](https://www.lifemiles.com/fly/find)\n. You will need to create a Lifemiles account to access.\n\n(As you can see, it does pay to have exposure to various Big 5 programs so you can always get the optimal redemption.)\n\nKnowing how alliances work can lead to tremendous savings and help us easily maximize our points. It’s not always easy to find these redemptions though, and exploring the whole web of airlines alliances can get complicated. That’s why point hacking is a skill, and it definitely takes practice to get better at it! In the “Advanced” section below, I share a few tips for finding these redemptions, and I’ll share more in future issues too.\n\nBy the way, that March 30th EWR-LHR flight I’ve been using as my example? That’s a real flight with actual award availability as of 6am this morning. Good points deals often get snapped up fast, so take a look if you’re interested!\n\nLike what you see so far? Subscribe for the next free issue, coming out in 2 weeks!\n\nSubscribe\n\nSome notes on redemption rates\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n*   Typically you’ll see the really mouthwatering redemptions (>= 5¢/pt) on premium cabins. However, you can still find nice economy redemptions at a rate of 2-3¢/pt! For instance, our example EWR-LHR flight costs $460 for economy and is also available for 20k Avianca Lifemiles; that’s 2.3¢/pt.\n    \n\n*   I’ve talked a lot about how you can get > 1¢/point by transferring points. But since the redemption rate isn’t fixed in most frequent flyer programs, the opposite can also be true. Sometimes you may see terrible redemptions of 0.5¢/point, in which case you need to look elsewhere, book via the credit card portal, or maybe even just book on cash.\n    \n\nHow do I actually transfer points?\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nUsually you can transfer points in your credit card’s rewards portal. Look for words like “transfer to partners”. From here, you’ll be asked to link your frequent flyer account — ensure that you’re entering your member number accurately! Once you’ve done that, you’ll be able to transfer points, usually in increments of 1000 points.\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4ef0d5-26d9-4017-a1d5-18d68750b25c_2852x1676.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NvjA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4ef0d5-26d9-4017-a1d5-18d68750b25c_2852x1676.png)\n\nFor Chase, you can go to the Ultimate Rewards portal [here](https://ultimaterewardspoints.chase.com/home)\n and click “Transfer points to partners” under the “Travel” tab.\n\nFor most partners, the transfer is nearly instant. Go make a coffee and your freshly transferred miles should be deposited in your frequent flyer account by the time you’re back. On some occasions though, the transfer can take longer. This can be a bit inconvenient if you’re booking a particularly popular award ticket that may run out of space; I’ll talk about how to get around this in a future issue.\n\nDoes this mean I should never use my points my credit card’s travel portal?\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNope! If you’re trying to save cash, ultimately free travel is free travel. You might not be maximizing your points, but that might not be what matters then. However, be careful not to exhaust _all_ your points in the portal; missing a killer partner redemption because you’re out of points is quite painful.\n\nMany portals also offer a combo of cash + points payment option. This can help take the edge off a particularly pricey flight by letting you, in effect, set your own preferred discount using points. I recently did this for a last-minute domestic flight; flights were $200 more than usual, so I used 13,000 points to offset the increase. Additionally, by using the Chase portal with my Chase Sapphire Reserve, my points were valued 50% higher (1.5¢/pt), and I earned 5x points on the cash portion— not bad!\n\n[](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-1#poll-135647)\n\nPOLL\n\n### What should I cover next?\n\nWhat's up with the Bilt card?\n\n40%\n\nHow do I pick my next card?\n\n28%\n\nHow to earn more points for free?\n\n32%\n\nPOLL CLOSED\n\nFor experts: Two of my favorite underrated transfer partners\n\n\n==============================================================\n\nAs experts, you’ve probably used your fair share of transfer partners and gotten some awesome redemptions. There’s a few programs I don’t think get enough love, and I figure I’d talk about them below and exactly how you can add them to your repertoire.\n\nTypes of award space\n\n\n----------------------\n\n(For some of you, this may be review; I just want to make sure we have a shared vocabulary here!)\n\nNot all award space is created equally. Usually when an airlines releases award tickets for a given flight, they release it into 4 buckets:\n\n*   Airline saver space\n    \n*   Non-saver space\n    \n*   Partner saver space\n    \n\nAirline saver space is a special promotional rate offered for award tickets. If you can snag one of these rates, you know you’re getting the best points rate that program can offer. Often airlines will have a fixed rate for saver space (e.g. “one way US-Europe economy = 20k”), but unfortunately many US-based airlines have dynamic rates even for saver space. There’s very limited seats available in this bucket, and once it’s exhausted, you’re just left with non-saver space.\n\nNon-saver space is usually much pricier (think ~2x the cost), and is more likely to be dynamically priced based on demand (read: you’re not gonna get a stellar redemption rate here). Non-saver space can still be worth booking though if the cash fare for the flight is super expensive.\n\nFinally the partner saver space bucket is similar to airline saver space, but allocated for the airlines’ partners instead. The partner program is allowed to choose whatever pricing strategy they want for these seats, and often, the best deals come from partners that price their partner saver space cheaper than the airlines’ own saver space. One catch: the amount of partner saver seats is less than the amount of airline saver space, so if you find one, you better book fast.\n\nTurkish Airlines Miles&Smiles for domestic coast-to-coast trips on United\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### The Sweet Spot\n\nYes, weirdly enough the cheapest way to fly across the USA on points is through a non-US based airline! The Miles&Smiles program uses a region-based award chart where the point cost of a flight depends on your start and end region. Generally most programs using such charts tend to split the US into an East and a West region, which bumps up the cost of flying cross country. Fortunately, Turkish Airlines has a sweet spot here: flights within a single country count as flying within a single region, _regardless of the size of the country_. If we reference their [award charts](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-us/miles-and-smiles/redeem-miles/redeem-miles-on-flights/turkish-airlines-award-tickets/)\n, we can see the saver (“promotional”) award ticket rate for domestic/intracountry flights is just:\n\n*   **Economy one way for 7.5k miles**\n    \n*   Business one way for 12.5k miles\n    \n\n(Turkish is in Star Alliance, so these flights are actually just United flights being cross-sold by Turkish.)\n\nThis is such a ridiculously low cost award that has managed to stay under the radar for quite a while now. But there’s a good reason for that: for the longest time, the only way to transfer to Turkish was through Citi or Capital One, which aren’t as popular. But that’s all changed with the Bilt card; it’s one of the fastest growing cards in America, and they have recently become the 3rd transfer partner for Turkish. Now these deals are way more accessible to travelers!\n\n### Finding Award Availability\n\nUnlike other airlines, Turkish Airlines unfortunately doesn’t let you see a calendar of available dates, which makes finding award availability hard. However, we can use a little trick: we can use a different Star Alliance partner with a better award search tool to find the available dates, and then pop those dates into the Turkish award search and book from there. This works because **all Star Alliance partners will have access to the same partner saver space**; it’s just a matter of finding it.\n\nAir Canada Aeroplan is known for having a really great award search tool for Star Alliance partner space, so we can just pop in our origin + destination city here and some rough idea of a date we want to travel on. Once you sign into your Aeroplan account, you’ll be able to see a 5 day availability calendar at the top. Generally you’re looking for anything that is priced low (like 15k miles or less), and on United metal — chances are that’s partner saver space.\n\nLet’s look for NYC > SFO for Feb 13 (perfect V-Day timing for all the cross-country long distance couples!).\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd187cb70-6b68-4d14-968c-61f1c715e800_2568x1750.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mg_f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd187cb70-6b68-4d14-968c-61f1c715e800_2568x1750.png)\n\nFound on the Air Canada Aeroplan award search tool [here](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home.html)\n. Make sure to check the “Book with Aeroplan” box and make an Aeroplan account to see the calendar.\n\nAccording to the calendar at the top, we could also book on Feb 12 or Feb 14, but not Feb 11.\n\nNow that we’ve identified a date that has partner saver space, we can head back to Turkish and search there:\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F746bf6f2-9148-4caa-9bc0-da5adb3e97cb_2058x1104.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H3IV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F746bf6f2-9148-4caa-9bc0-da5adb3e97cb_2058x1104.png)\n\nAnd voila! We found Turkish partner saver space for this domestic United flight, and its just 7.5k Turkish miles compared to 12.5k Air Canada miles!\n\nOne caveat: before you get too excited about the 12.5k mile domestic business class redemptions, I should say that it’s very very hard to find award availability for this one. I’ve never succeeded on it personally, and if you find it, you might wanna buy a lottery ticket. The economy tickets are usually very doable though.\n\nAir France/KLM Flying Blue for insanely cheap trips to Europe\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis one isn’t that underrated, and is actually one of the more popular redemptions for people who are getting started in the points game. It doesn’t hurt that Flying Blue is a transfer partner for each of the Big 5 credit card programs too! The reason I’ve still listed it here is many people tend to consider Flying Blue as just a good way to book Delta awards if you don’t have an Amex, but they’re missing the best part: Flying Blue promo rates.\n\n**Every month, Flying Blue releases a new set of cities that they offer promotional pricing on (usually 25% off their regular partner saver rates)**. As long as you fly between any country in Europe and these cities, you’re eligible for the discounted pricing (while seats last of course). The discounted pricing is in effect for trips within 6 months of the current month, so the January promos are in effect for trips till June 30.\n\nUnfortunately there’s no US-based cities on this list for January, but in December, you could have booked flights from the following cities for a discount:\n\n*   Washington D.C. to Europe from 15k miles (25% off)\n    \n*   Boston to Europe from 15k miles (25% off)\n    \n\nThis month there are lots of Canadian cities on the list though (Toronto, Montreal, Ottowa), so for my Canadian friends out there, it’s your time to shine! You can always see the list of cities [here](https://www.flyingblue.com/en/spend/flights/rewards)\n under “Long-Haul Flights” (I suggest bookmarking this link!)\n\nLet’s check out an example. Let’s say you’re looking to do V-Day in the city of love, Paris. We can pop in Toronto for the origin and Paris for the destination, and select Business. Seems there’s some partner saver space for Feb 13! You can tell because the button is in green; non-saver space is shown in blue.\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bdc282-1ec4-4aab-a184-777ae174413e_2122x1144.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!j57B!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2bdc282-1ec4-4aab-a184-777ae174413e_2122x1144.png)\n\n50k ain’t bad for Air France business class! You will need to pay a bit of a higher fee here (220 euros), but this flight is going for $5526 right now, so you’re getting an insane 10.5¢/pt redemption here. What a steal for V-day in Paris.\n\n(Pro tip: You don’t have to _reside_ in Toronto to take this flight…there’s dozens of NYC <> YYZ flights every day, and you could just book a cheap one like the one below, chill in the Air Canada lounge for free with your business class ticket, and hop over to Paris from there.)\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10b3f671-fe2f-4209-ab76-7aa1bb69b8ef_2088x526.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g3Il!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10b3f671-fe2f-4209-ab76-7aa1bb69b8ef_2088x526.png)\n\nThere’s so many more underrated transfer partners I could include, but this issue is getting kinda long, so I’ll throw ‘em in a future issue!\n\n[](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-1#poll-135649)\n\nPOLL\n\n### What should I cover next?\n\nHow to hack airline status\n\n50%\n\nMore transfer partners please!\n\n19%\n\nHow do upgrades actually work?\n\n31%\n\nPOLL CLOSED\n\nDeals and Other Awesome Stuff\n\n\n===============================\n\n*   Bilt Dining has 100 restaurants participating in NYC Restaurant Week!

It’s a justified question: their ads are everywhere from airports to subways, and they’ve quickly become one of the hottest credit cards on the market.\n\nIn my opinion they very much deserve the hype. I was a skeptic when I first heard of the card, but their team continues to deliver tremendous value. Here’s a few reasons why Bilt has quickly reached the top of my card stack.\n\nPoints on Rent\n\n\n================\n\nThe marquee benefit of Bilt is the ability to earn 1x points on rent _without paying the credit card transaction fees_. Technically, you can earn 1x points on rent on many other cards too (rent would just fall in the “other” purchases category) but you’d have to pay a ~3% transaction fee, which wouldn’t be worth it in most cases. Bilt lets you bypass those fees and feasibly earn points on your rent. If you’re living in a typical US metro area, you’ll easily earn tens of thousands of free points per year this way! Given this is the only card product on the market that does this, it’s natural to have some questions:\n\n*   _“So wait are they just fronting the transaction fee?”:_ Nope, Bilt spins up a special bank account that has your rent preloaded, and you use that to pay for your rent instead of your personal bank account. Your online rent payment portal will omit the standard credit card fee since you’re technically paying via bank transfer, and Bilt will charge you for the debited amount.\n    \n*   _“What if I don’t have an online rent portal?”:_ Bilt can send a check, PayPal, or Venmo to your landlord. This requires a bit of one-time setup, but you’ll earn points all the same. They don’t support Zelle yet unfortunately.\n    \n*   _“What if I Venmo my share of the rent to my roommate? How about subletting?”:_ Bilt can handle this too. You can set your special Bilt bank account as a payment option in Venmo and use that to pay your roommate. Bilt may ask for lease verification if you go this route though, which means YMMV for sublet situations.\n    \n*   _“Any catch?”:_ You need to use your Bilt card 5x a month to earn points on rent, but that’s about it! As you’ll see below, you’ll want to use it way more than that anyway.\n    \n\nThe card isn’t just a one trick pony, and you’ll also earn 3x points on dining and 2x on travel. The dining multiplier rivals the best cards on the market, but that travel multiplier is middle of pack; I’d use other premium travel cards like the Amex Platinum card to book travel if you have them.\n\nSurprisingly Good Transfer Partners\n\n\n=====================================\n\nCool, so you can earn points on rent, but that’s only worth something if the points are useful. As we discussed in [Issue 1](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-1)\n, points are only as good as their transfer partners, and honestly, I’ve been shocked by how good the list is for Bilt:\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140605279/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa35384ca-4a32-4767-909c-522ac82897a3_2103x475.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bslf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa35384ca-4a32-4767-909c-522ac82897a3_2103x475.png)\n\nThat’s a pretty impressive list. Here’s some highlights:\n\n*   Bilt is the **ONLY** card program that transfers to **American**. Oneworld loyalists rejoice! Also, American has been putting up some impressively cheap award tickets for Asia travel lately, but more on that in a future issue.\n    \n*   Bilt also covers **United**, which makes them the only card program that partners with 2 major US airlines. If you’re also sitting on an Amex, note that this gives you direct point transfers to the full US trifecta: United, American, and Delta.\n    \n*   [I’ve written about](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/air-franceklm-flying-blue-for-insanely-cheap-trips-to-europe)\n     **[Air France/KLM](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/air-franceklm-flying-blue-for-insanely-cheap-trips-to-europe)\n    ** [before](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/air-franceklm-flying-blue-for-insanely-cheap-trips-to-europe)\n    , and it’s a fantastic program for dirt cheap Europe trips. **Air Canada**, **British Airways**, **Virgin Atlantic** are also fantastic for a whole variety of partner awards, and I’ll certainly write about them soon. Most major card programs are partnered with these four airlines though, so this isn’t a unique benefit.\n    \n*   **Turkish Airlines** and **Avianca** are stellar options for rare but super high value redemptions within Star Alliance. If you’re curious, you can learn how [I saved 70k-90k points using these programs](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-1#%C2%A7if-you-want-to-go-far-go-together-the-magic-of-airline-alliances)\n     for an EWR-LHR trip, and [how I used Turkish](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/turkish-airlines-miles-and-smiles-for-domestic-coast-to-coast-trips-on-united)\n     to fly cross country for a mere 7.5k miles. Turkish isn’t partnered with Amex or Chase, and Avianca isn’t partnered with Chase, so if you’re holding these cards, Bilt helps round out your transfer partner portfolio.\n    \n\nHonestly, their BizDev team must be doing the most. I’ve personally been very invested in the Chase ecosystem, yet I’ve found myself spending more on Bilt lately because Bilt has access to killer partners I just don’t have on Chase.\n\nLearning something from this post?

Every Rent Day, Bilt provides some wildly good deal or transfer bonus or status trial that’s usually hard or even impossible to find otherwise. Here’s some examples from the past:\n\n*   Up to 150% transfer bonuses for frequent flyer programs like Air France/KML Flying Blue, Emirates Skywards, and Virgin Atlantic Flying Club.\n    \n*   Up to 18x on restaurants partnered with Bilt (more on that below).\n    \n*   Complimentary United Silver or Gold status for 120 days, with the potential to retain it for a full year.\n    \n*   90 day free trial of World of Hyatt Explorist status, [Hyatt’s 2nd best status tier](https://world.hyatt.com/content/gp/en/tiers-and-benefits.html#charts)\n     providing complimentary room upgrades and late checkouts.\n    \n\nTransfer bonuses of 150% are absolutely unprecedented in the points world; usually people would rejoice over a 30% transfer bonus on the other major card programs. And re: the restaurant points boost, I have a friend who put his Bilt card down on a $750 friends’ dinner and walked away with a whopping 12k points — a free cross-country flight right there.\n\n_(Note that some bonuses scale with your Bilt status tier. I won’t get into it this time, but Bilt has their own status program and you earn status based on the points you’ve earned. But even the entry-level tier got 75% transfer bonuses; still an insane deal.)_\n\nBilt is perhaps the most gamified, content-forward, and youthful of the Big 5 credit card programs, and as such they have some fun Rent day programming too:\n\n*   Point Quest: A trivia show where you earn up to 250 points for answering current events questions. (They also release their content on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@pointquest?lang=en)\n    !)\n    \n    [![Bilt Rewards on X: \"We're bringing our game show, Point Quest, to the Bilt  app on Rent Day (10/1).

Dining goes from 3x to 6x, Travel goes from 2x to 4x, and all other non-rent spending goes from 1x to 2x.\n    \n\nBilt Dining\n\n\n=============\n\nBilt has partnered with a whole variety of restaurants in major US metro cities, and you’ll earn anywhere from 2x to 10x extra points per dollar when you dine there. That’s on top of the 3x points you earn from any dining transaction on your Bilt.\n\n**One of the coolest parts of this program is you don’t even need to use your Bilt card; you can register other cards you own into your “Bilt Wallet” and you’ll still earn the extra Bilt points!**\n\nI’ve registered my Chase Sapphire Reserve in my Bilt Wallet. Now let’s say I go eat at one of my new favorite NYC spots, [8282 in Lower East Side](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w8A2Vg4QJgvtR9kVA)\n. 8282 is listed as a +3x Bilt Dining partner. I’ve got two options to earn points on my meal:\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140605279/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d59c77d-0bc2-4f22-9fa9-e11d092a5e89_2370x1687.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rbQx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d59c77d-0bc2-4f22-9fa9-e11d092a5e89_2370x1687.png)\n\nAs you can see, Bilt Dining affords you flexibility on how you earn points on your nights out, which can be very useful as you try to build up points balances in multiple programs.\n\nYou can see the full list of Bilt Dining restaurants [here](https://www.biltrewards.com/rewards/dining)\n. Bilt Dining has restaurants in many major cities like NYC, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, Miami, and more, but I will say that some cities definitely have a more developed list of restaurant choices.\n\n**Also, as of yesterday it’s officially NYC restaurant week, and there’s plenty of Bilt Dining restaurants on the list right now! If you’ve already got the card, there’s a whole list of them in the app.**\n\nBilt Experiences\n\n\n==================\n\nMany major credit card programs technically offer “exclusive experiences” for cardholders, but it’s often hard to access these, and they’re typically quite niche. Bilt has a significantly better experience program with events you’ll likely want to go to. In the past, they’ve offered unique dining experiences and even box tickets at NFL games bookable on points.\n\nI went to one of their events in November at [Meduza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JyaSWq4Q5i1aKvMa9)\n, an up-and-coming mediterranean restaurant that had literally just opened a few days prior! It was a lovely 5 course menu with a cocktail pairing, and the vibes were excellent. They had all the guests sit on a long table together, so everyone got to socialize and become friends while drinking way too much. Plus they had some of the Bilt team at the event too, and I got to ask a bunch of my prying questions about the card.\n\n![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140605279/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3e32129-0ab9-4375-9030-7a202914e204.heic)![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140605279/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9dd235-3fff-4f06-9eda-b58cdd0b4e0f.heic)![](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140605279/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa09e141f-bd4b-48e7-bb7e-bad9e0519f62.heic)\n\n5 course menu in a super vibey spot. The bluefin tuna tartare topped with caviar was definitely one of my faves.\n\nThe dining experiences were bookable in the Bilt app for $150/seat or 12,500 Bilt points; I personally opted for the former because I know I can extract more than 1.2¢ of value per point. They’ve also run dining experiences in Miami, Dallas, and Boston.\n\nI’m not personally the biggest football fan, but back in September, they also let cardholders book spots in a box suite for a Jets vs. Chiefs game. The cost was just 10k Bilt points — given that a typical box suite goes from $5-25k for 20 people, this was quite the steal! Plus [apparently Taylor Swift attended that game](https://people.com/every-photo-of-taylor-swift-and-her-friends-at-chiefs-vs-jets-game-8303570)\n to cheer on Travis Kelce, so who knows, you could have bumped into her at the stadium too.\n\nPeace of Mind + Protections\n\n\n=============================\n\nBecause the Bilt card is also a World Elite Mastercard, you get some additional travel protections for peace of mind:\n\n*   _Auto rental collision damage waiver_: Rent a car and you can decline the extra collision insurance from the rental company.\n    \n*   _Trip delay reimbursement_: If your trip gets delayed 6+ hrs, they’ll help cover costs.\n    \n*   _Trip cancellation protection_: If your trip gets cancelled due to medical reasons, they’ll reimburse you even for non-refundable plans.\n    \n*   _Cellphone protection_: If you pay your phone bill with Bilt, they’ll pay you if you phone gets destroyed or stolen.\n    \n*   _Purchase protection_: Buy something recently and it got destroyed or stolen? Bilt will reimburse you.\n    \n\nI’m being a bit vague on the exact terms and reimbursements deliberately, since that deserves its own post. _Most travel-focused cards have these protections too, but not all protections are created equal_. The devil tends to be in the details, and having reviewed the fine print myself, I’ll say Bilt is probably below average in terms of the quality of these protections. Still, something is better than nothing, but if you’ve got cards like a Chase Sapphire or Capital One VentureX, I’d rely more on those protections instead. I’ll do a proper deep dive that compares the different cards and their protections in a future issue.\n\nBest Part: $0 Annual Fee\n\n\n==========================\n\n**All of this comes for a $0 annual fee**, which is honestly a bit wild. This makes it a super friendly “first travel card” for beginners, and an easy addition for experts.\n\n[](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-2#poll-137611)\n\nPOLL\n\n### What can I help with next? How to...\n\nPick an airline to commit to\n\n46%\n\nHack multicity trips with stopovers\n\n54%\n\nEarn up to 5% on online shopping\n\n0%\n\nPOLL CLOSED\n\nMy Verdict\n\n\n============\n\nFriends have been asking me for years about the best card to start travel hacking with, and I used to say the Chase Sapphire Preferred. While that’s still an awesome card, it has a $95 annual fee, and Bilt is free with amazing benefits and partners to boot. I would highly recommend this card for beginners, but as I discussed above, there’s plenty of perks even for seasoned veterans. Even if you don’t pay rent, the rent day bonuses and transfer partners alone make the card worth it.\n\nThe card is definitely targeted towards younger generations living in major US metro cities, which is a refreshing positioning compared to some of the other cards. If you’re based in NYC, Bilt has an especially strong presence here (they’re based here after all), but you’ll also get a decently fulfilling set of perks and benefits on Bilt Dining and Bilt Experiences in other major US cities.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I’m also generally amazed at how fast their team has been building and how they’ve carved out a growing wedge in an otherwise oligopolized market run by legacy players. More than other cards, they’ve been focusing a lot on strategic partnerships that lend the card more utility, revenue streams, and virality. I have to imagine Bilt has identified fairly diverse revenue streams given their $0 fee strategy. This all means there’s likely more to come with this card!\n\n* * *\n\nIf you do decide to get a Bilt, I would appreciate if you use my [referral link](https://bilt.page/r/IDXF-KLKE)\n below!

I'm new to the points game and wanted to clarify a few things you mentioned.\n\nMy understanding is that for people who are starting travel hacking, Bilt is not a great card because there is no signup bonus, which, if your goal is to travel hack, is how you will rack up most of your points. My thinking is that it's best to get Bilt and use it for rent, and for your minimum 5 transactions each moth, and then after that to put all your spend on cards you are trying to get signup bonuses for. My thinking is that if I have $5K to spend, even with the crazy Bilt transfer bonuses, it doesn't compare to getting 75K or 100K points from a signup.\n\nExpand full comment\n\n[Like](javascript:void(0))\n\nReply\n\nShare\n\nTopLatestDiscussions\n\n[How to get 10x the value from your points](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-1)\n\n[If you've seen people zooming around the world for free on points, it's not because they're point millionaires.
