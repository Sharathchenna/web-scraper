As a result, customers’ expectations have risen dramatically. Access to data and insights is no exception. A trend that has gained significant traction is the demand for customer-facing analytics, also known as embedded analytics. Users now expect that high-quality analytics features are seamlessly integrated into their SaaS products/product experience. Below, I outline the reasons users want customer-facing analytics.\n\nUsers crave convenience. They want seamless access to analytics within their existing workflows. Customer-facing analytics that are embedded within the platform they already use for their day-to-day operations reduces the product friction to almost zero. Data and insights are surfaced naturally as users take action in the application or are at most a few clicks away. By providing users with actionable insights without the need to switch platforms, customer-facing or embedded analytics not only enhances user experience by eliminating the need for users to navigate multiple tools but also ensures that users can make informed decisions faster and more efficiently.\n\nUsers want easy wins. They want analytics that are relevant, accurate, & actionable; and SaaS vendors are best positioned to deliver on this. SaaS vendors have unique advantages when providing analytics: 1) they deeply understand their use cases, users, and best practices; and 2) they possess a wealth of data across their customer base, allowing them to aggregate and analyze data at scale, identifying trends, benchmarks, and patterns that individual customers might miss. This domain specific knowledge and data enables them to provide targeted insights that address industry-specific challenges or optimize domain-specific workflows. Overall this expertise gives SaaS vendors the opportunity to provide the highest-leverage analytics that are perfectly tailored to their customers' needs.\n\nUsers want products that are familiar and easy to use. When embedded or customer-facing analytics are well-designed, users can interact with data in a way that feels natural within the context of the application, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction. Just as SaaS vendors leverage their understanding of users, use cases, and best practices to surface the most valuable insights, they also have a significant advantage in providing the ideal UI/UX. By tailoring the user interface and experience to the specific needs of their users, SaaS vendors can ensure that analytics features are intuitive and accessible. This is especially important considering that most users are data scientists or analysts. While data professionals may prefer advanced analytics or BI applications, these tools are often not suitable for every user. Many important stakeholders—such as executives, managers, and business leaders— are non-technical business users that need insights to make strategic decisions but lack the expertise to navigate complex data platforms. Embedded analytics can provide the optimal UI/UX by offering familiar design patterns and aligning with users' natural workflows.\n\nAs businesses increasingly rely on data to drive decisions, the demand for customer-facing analytics within SaaS products will continue to grow. When designed well, the vast majority of users will prefer customer-facing or embedded analytics offered within their SaaS product over specialized analytics tool due the the natural advantages SaaS vendors have: they can offer unparalleled convenience, leverage their deep understanding of user needs, and deliver an optimal user experience. In a competitive market, offering embedded analytics can be a key differentiator that drives success for both you and your customers.\n\n[Book demo\\\n---------](https://cal.com/quillsql/30min)\n[See docs\\\n--------](https://docs.quillsql.com/)",

It represents an evolution from traditional on-premises data systems to a more scalable, flexible, and efficient approach enabled by the cloud.\n\nThe MDS typically includes several key components, however, not all companies use or need all components. Accordingly, the components below are organized into two sections:\n\nThe basic stack includes the necessary core components of any modern data stack. The basic stack is designed to meet the fundamental needs of businesses that are starting to leverage data for decision-making and operational efficiency. Typically, these are small to mid-sized companies or startups that need to establish a reliable data infrastructure without overcomplicating their operations. The primary use case is to ensure that data is efficiently ingested, stored, and made available for analysis and reporting. This stack focuses on three core components:\n\n| Component | Tools | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Data Ingestion and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | Fivetran, Stitch, Airbyte, Apache NiFi. | To extract data from various sources, transform it as needed, and load it into a data warehouse |\n| Data Warehousing | Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Azure Synapse | To store large volumes of data in a structured format that supports efficient querying and analysis |\n| Business Intelligence and Analytics | Looker, Tableau, Power BI, Metabase | To analyze data and create visualizations, dashboards, and reports for business insights |\n\nThe advanced stack describes additional components that support more complex and sophisticated data needs. Components in this stack are suitable for larger enterprises or businesses with extensive data requirements, such as real-time processing, advanced analytics, and machine learning capabilities. Key components include:\n\n| Component | Tools | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Data Orchestration and Workflow Management | Apache Airflow, Prefect, Dagster | To automate and manage data workflows and pipelines. As ETL workloads increase (in terms of number of jobs, transformation complexity, and/or data volume), organizations need a way to manage and monitor these. |\n| Data Transformation & Semantic layer | dbt (data build tool), Matillion, Cube | To clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis and reporting. The ETL tools listed in the basic stack generally load data in a predetermined, usually multi-table structure (normalized data). Semantic layer and Transformation tools help companies transform normalized data into a custom schema (denormalized data) that makes the most sense for their business and use-case(s). |\n| Data Governance and Cataloging | Alation, Collibra, DataHub | To manage data quality, ensure compliance, and provide data discovery, lineage, and cataloging capabilities. These tools are relevant for enterprises that are managing large volumes of data across multiple organizations and/or companies operating in regulated environments (GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA, etc.) and want to use a data governance tool to help comply with regulations. |\n| Data Storage | AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage | To store raw and processed data in a cost-effective and scalable manner. For companies managing very large data volumes, they may want to also use a cheaper object storage option for some use-cases (vs. DWH, which will have much higher storage costs). |\n| Machine Learning and Data Science | Databricks, DataRobot, SageMaker | To build, train, and deploy machine learning models and perform advanced data science tasks. |\n\n[Book demo\\\n---------](https://cal.com/quillsql/30min)\n[See docs\\\n--------](https://docs.quillsql.com/)",

Customer-facing analytics are ubiquitous across all kinds of software products, whether consumer, B2B, marketplace, data app, or tech-enabled service. Some common examples of customer-facing analytics are charts & graphs, data tables, dashboards, reporting tools, or even self-service analytics.\n\n\"User-facing analytics\" and \"embedded analytics\" are generally used interchangeably with the term \"customer-facing analytics\". However, data folks that really care about this stuff will tell you that embedded analytics is a specific variation of customer or user facing analytics that’s defined by, \"bringing data into familiar places to meet customers where they live, and encouraging curiosity with data that they would normally not be able or have time to interpret.\" Overall the descriptors \"customer-facing,\" \"user-facing,\" or \"embedded\" primarily distinguish analytics delivered as a product (or part of a product) to end-users or customers from internal or business-facing analytics, where analytics are delivered via a 3rd party application to internal stakeholders within a company. Companies almost exclusively use business intelligence (BI), data science notebook, or data app tools – such as PowerBI, Looker, Tableau, Hex, or Streamlit – for internal use-cases.\n\nCustomer-facing, user-facing, or embedded analytics should not be confused with product analytics (or sometimes called event analytics). Product analytics tools, like Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Posthog, may require implementing some frontend code, but this is invisible to end-users/customers, and the data/insights are used by internal company stakeholders. Specifically, product analytics tools enable product teams to ingest, process, and analyze user event and engagement data (e.g. conversion metrics, feature usage, active user count). Typically product teams use this data to improve and optimize their product experience.\n\n[Book demo\\\n---------](https://cal.com/quillsql/30min)\n[See docs\\\n--------](https://docs.quillsql.com/)",
