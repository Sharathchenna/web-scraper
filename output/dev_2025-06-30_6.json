      "content": "# The broken rhetoric of AI\n\n\n_A detox guide for designers navigating today’s AI discourse_\n\n\n[![Mike Schindler](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*Oo3S32Y2BwsUKXKOLqucYA@2x.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@mschindler?source=post_page---byline--f3a24165899d---------------------------------------)\n\n\n[Mike Schindler](https://medium.com/@mschindler?source=post_page---byline--f3a24165899d---------------------------------------)\n\n\n9 min read\n\n\n·\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\nAI-generated image by Mike Schindler\n\n\nWe really have some shitty ways of talking about AI.\n\n\nWe’re about a year into the Great AI Divide, or whatever our history-keeping algorithms decide to call this moment, and even the most literate among us can’t help falling into the same old rhetorical pitfalls — ones that seem to alienate more people than they invite into the conversation.\n\n\nWe’re losing ourselves to our worst instincts. Not because we’re doomed, but because we’re treating this moment like a game of hot takes and hustle. But right now is actually a rare and real opportunity for a smarter, more generous conversation — one that helps our design community navigate uncertainty with clarity, creativity, and a sense of shared agency.\n\n\nInstead, we’ve turned the discourse into a pissing contest.\n\n\nWho can get the most engagement?\n\n\nWho can rattle the most nerves?\n\n\nWho can [split the room](https://www.jackboxgames.com/games/split-the-room) and put the most distance between the supposedly old “archaic” ways and the newer, more exciting, vibey ones?\n\n\nIn this process we never think to ask if abdicating our creative judgment almost completely to the Large Language Model gods is a good idea. It’s like we’re a tribe of primitive Luddites offering up our drudgery in return for a magical oracle that only rewards the loudest acolytes.\n\n\nWe’re playing into our performative identities because we’re afraid of being left out in the cold.\n\n\nMeanwhile, we’re forgetting the most important thing:\n\n\n**There _are_ healthier ways to talk about all this.**\n\n\nNot to conjure a rose-colored world from the early 2000’s, but it was almost the exact same landscape of uncertainty, excitement, and novelty way back then. But somehow our approach and our sense of community was totally different.\n\n\nMaybe Limp Bizkit deserves more credit… hmm… (remembers the backwards red hat)… nah.\n\n\nBut I do remember because I was there. A lot of us were. And the evidence of the discourse taking a dangerous corner today is all around us.\n\n\n**Healthy conversations don’t make you feel gross.**\n\n\nThey don’t leave you rattled, reactive, or self-doubting.\n\n\nThey don’t flatten all of the nuance into an abstract point or pit us against each other in a weird flex-off.\n\n\nThey invite participation. They build. They move forward like a good improv scene — like a “yes, and…” that encourages more voices, more learning, and more possibility.\n\n\nEvery good designer knows that solving any complex problem means you have to _identify_ it first.\n\n\nSo that’s what this is. A simple ID exercise.\n\n\nA catalog of our worst impulses — not to shame, but to offer better, healthier alternatives.\n\n\nI’m certain that most of what we’re doing is unconscious and unintended by good-hearted people. But that’s just the point, isn’t it?\n\n\nBy surfacing the patterns in how we talk about AI — often with fear, status anxiety, and noise — I’m hoping we can grow past this weird liminal phase.\n\n\nNot heaven. Not hell. Just a low-level echo chamber where every LinkedIn post feels simultaneously urgent, predictable, and… exhausting.\n\n\nSo, what I’m proposing is a bit of a detox from our usual way of talking.\n\n\nAnd I’m suggesting some healthy alternatives instead.\n\n\nDesigned by Mike Schindler (mschindler.com)\n\n\n\n## ❌ FOMO\n\n\n> _“Everyone’s ahead of me. I need to catch up or I’ll be obsolete.”_\n\n\nThis is the dark hum of the current discourse. You see it between the lines of almost every AI post. The implication is simple. _If you’re not prompt-engineering throughout your entire design process, you’re already behind._\n\n\nSimple fear of missing out.\n\n\nIt’s not just anxiety — it’s a quiet arms race of self-erasure, where speed takes up all the oxygen in the room and thoughtful reflection somehow feels like a liability.\n\n\n\n### 🌱 A Healthier Way: Curiosity-Driven Learning\n\n\nThe truth is, [the cheese is _always_ moving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F).\n\n\nThat’s the nature of knowledge work. Change isn’t a moment — it’s our constant state of being.\n\n\nAs [Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker) famously warned:\n\n\n> “The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence — it is to act with yesterday’s logic.”\n\n\nAt the rate we’re going, every year, every month, even every week is more complex than the last. The pace won’t slow down — but the way we show up to each day _can_.\n\n\nSo what if we saw this moment not as an exercise in sprint conditioning, but as an invitation to learn?\n\n\nLeading with curiosity reframes the AI shift from _“What am I missing?”_ to _“What can I explore that aligns with my values, my practice, and the people I serve?”_\n\n\nIt puts the designer back in the loop — not as a bottleneck, but as a rational and strategic human-centered synthesizer.\n\n\nNot optimizing just for speed, but for shared understanding.\n\n\n\n## ❌ Gaslighting\n\n\n> _“Design is dead. AI has already replaced you. Stop trying.”_\n\n\nThe velocity of change we’re experiencing has created a kind of virtual chasm in our shared reality. It’s no wonder the discourse has taken on a theatrical tone — half prediction, half panic.\n\n\nEnter [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting).\n\n\nThat’s when the dread warriors, armed with half-baked provocations and usually a touch of _mansplaining_, sow doubt under the guise of thought leadership. Their goal isn’t clarity or education — it’s status.\n\n\nIf you’ve started to question your own sanity, that’s an important clue and here’s what to tell yourself. You’re probably still grounded. The gaslighters just want you to think otherwise.\n\n\nThis isn’t just annoying. It’s manipulative. It’s pervasive. And it’s all too common in our professional and political atmospheres.\n\n\nBut here’s the thing. We don’t have to accept their reality as our fate.\n\n\nEven if only a fraction of what they say is true, the rest is still noise — and we have the right to filter for our own peace of mind.\n\n\n\n### 🌱 A Healthier Way: Critical Perspective\n\n\nI go by a simple rule of thumb.\n\n\nYour experience is not my experience.\n\n\nInstead of questioning if every move we make relative to our peers or competitors is correct or not, why don’t we just recognize each other as unique individuals, all in our respective places in work and in life?\n\n\nChances are the gaslighters live in a bubble filled with their own innate [Blue Velvet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Booth_(Blue_Velvet)) gas. Let them suck it all in while you stay sane.\n\n\n\n## ❌ Clickbait\n\n\n> _“AI will replace UX.” or “No-code is the end of design.”_\n\n\nWe’ve all seen the headlines. We’ve all clicked the links.\n\n\nThis daily apocalypse is a new kind of engagement economy. Let’s call it **Hysteria-as-a-Service**. Crafted by people who are either too clever by half or too thoughtless by whole.\n\n\nThese proclamations don’t predict the future — they provoke the present.\n\n\nThey divide us into two groups. The doomed and the destined. The washed and the winners.\n\n\nIt’s narrative bait for our most primitive instincts.\n\n\nShame on them for leading us with these clicks.\n\n\nClick again, and shame on us — and Shamu for that matter… (sorry, that was a shame spiral).\n\n\nI get it. We’re visceral beings. We sat through eight seasons of _Game of Thrones_ because [the pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Is_Coming) blew up everything we thought we knew about the rules of television— and the rest of the show kept us locked in with intermittent sex, violence, and surprise beheadings.\n\n\nThe internet does the same thing, only without the sets or the CGI dragons. It thrives on the tease. But unlike Westeros, there’s rarely any payoff.\n\n\nEvery article promising _“The Death of Design Is Coming Sooner Than You Think”_ or _“Why I’m Leaving UX (and You Should Too)”_ echoes in a sea of sameness. The volume is high, but the depth is shallow.",
