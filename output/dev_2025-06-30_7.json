I hope you didn’t miss me too much, but rest assured, Shreycation is back and here to stay. In a later post I’ll share a bit more about what I’ve been up to (launching the world’s first hybrid human + AI travel agency, [Anecdote Travel](https://anecdote.travel/)!), but for now, there’s something more pressing: helping you get flights for your Europe summer plans.\n\n\nNothing quite says summer like hopping across the Atlantic to sip an Aperol spritz, but if you’re a procrastinator like me, those flights are getting pricey.\n\n\n[clear wine glass with orange liquid](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1615830783066-26a99bc9d959?fm=jpg&q=60&w=3000&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D \"clear wine glass with orange liquid\")\n\n\nI know I can just buy some Aperol from my local Safeway, but it just tastes better in Europe ya feel?\n\n\nHere’s the price map for roundtrips between San Francisco and various spots in Europe. Big yikes:\n\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7afed0cd-955d-4663-842d-71690e2c734b_2212x1580.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1Xmb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7afed0cd-955d-4663-842d-71690e2c734b_2212x1580.png)\n\n\nReally, there’s nothing south of $1000. Fortunately, you read Shreycation and we’ve identified the best opportunities for you to use your points. Here’s how you can get your bank to pick up the tab for your sunny spree on the Spanish coast.\n\n\n\n## Air France/KLM Flying Blue\n\n\n[You may remember my love for the Air France and KLM’s joint program, Flying Blue.](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-1#%C2%A7air-franceklm-flying-blue-for-insanely-cheap-trips-to-europe)\n\nEvery month, Flying Blue chooses a set of cities to enjoy a promotional discount of 25% off — if you fly from those cities to basically anywhere in Europe, you’ll be able to enjoy the promo rate, if they have availability.\n\n\nEconomy flights between the USA and Europe cost 25k Flying Blue points one-way usually, so with the 25% discount, you’re looking at 18.75k points instead. And as a cherry on top, if you’ve got a Chase card, Chase Ultimate Rewards currently has a 25% transfer bonus to Flying Blue. **That means you just need to transfer 15k Chase points to Flying Blue** — that’ll get boosted to 18.75k, and you’re looking at a free flight to Europe!\n\n\nThe current promo cities are also quite convenient for my coastal readers here: **San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington, Miami, Boston**, and even my hometown of **Phoenix** are all getting repped this time! Even some of my readers over in Asia are getting some love, with discount fares from Hong Kong and Singapore. I’ve rarely seen such a convenient set of origin cities for Flying Blue promo award, so take advantage now. ([Full list of promo cities here](https://www.flyingblue.us/en/spend/flights/rewards).)\n\n\nGenerally, I saw a decent amount of availability left for July and August flights. Here’s a sample one I found for SF to Madrid on July 5:\n\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0106fa-d952-4d4f-b2c5-819da41fc74c_1910x754.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BWS5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0106fa-d952-4d4f-b2c5-819da41fc74c_1910x754.png)\n\n\nFlying Blue does charge you for fuel surcharges, so you’ll still owe some money, but it’s still a great deal. Let’s do some quick maths: this flight costs $610 on Google Flights, so after the $120 in surcharges, we’re using 18750 Flying Blue miles to pay for the remaining $490. If you’re transferring from Chase, you’re really only burning 15000 Chase points, so that’s **$490/15000 = 3.2¢/point, more than double what your points are worth in the Chase portal**!\n\n\nIf you like a little more luxury, business class tickets are 45k points as long as you fly from Montreal — this might be a viable move for my NYC friends here (just grab a cheap NYC > Montreal flight, and fly business across the pond).\n\n\nA few quick tips for this Flying Blue promotion:\n\n\n*   **The promotion is almost over — May 31 is the last day to book.** However, you can book for any dates up till Oct 31, so there’s no need to fly soon. New promo rates will go live in June, but the origin cities might not be this convenient.\n\n*   If you need to change or cancel, it costs 70 EUR. Even if you’re not sure about your trip, given how good the savings are, it might still be worth getting a ticket.\n\n*   Even if you don’t live in one of the origin cities, you can just buy a cheap flight to one of those cities, and then fly from there.\n\n*   Not all dates will have the promo rates still available. We’re in the last 2 days of this promotion, so many June dates are gone by now, but just use their point calendar at the top of the search screen to locate the 18750 mile fares. It bugs out sometimes when you search roundtrips, so I’d suggest searching one-ways instead.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThanks for reading Shreycation! We’re so excited to be back up and running. Subscribe for more, and share with a friend.\n\n\n[Share](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/snacks-its-not-too-late-for-euro?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share)\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n## Virgin Atlantic\n\n\nAnother one of my favorite hacks for getting to Europe for cheap is using Virgin Atlantic. For many summer dates, you can fly from NYC to London for just 12k Virgin Atlantic miles. And even better, Chase is also running a 25% transfer bonus for Virgin Atlantic too — you can be in London for just 9600 Chase points.\n\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31661910-efa0-49b7-8373-1dfb4daa5629_1802x536.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yqjg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws",

      "content": "Robinhood's Latest Quest\n\n========================\n\n\n\n### Is the new Gold credit card really a bullseye?\n\n\nShrey G\n\nMar 28, 2024\n\n\nHi Shreycationers,\n\n\nThis week I was gonna talk about how to hack basic economy, but then Robinhood upended those plans when they dropped one of their biggest announcements in years: a 3% cash back credit card.\n\n\nCredit: Robinhood\n\n\nI mean she is truly a stunning card. But looks aren’t everything. Let’s dive in and see what this card is made of.\n\n\n(It’s made of 17 grams of stainless steel.)\n\n\n_(Disclaimer: This post is not financial advice and you should do your own research to ensure the cards mentioned in this article are right for you. Applying will likely affect your credit score.)_\n\n\nWhat’s great\n\n==============\n\n\nFirst things first, Robinhood’s done a great job stealing headlines with this card, and it’s not just all show. This is indeed a wonderfully designed card.\n\n\nA simple 3% cash back on everything\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nEveryone’s talking about the flagship feature, the 3% cash back on everything. **And with good reason: 3% is the highest base cash back rate across any card I’ve seen.** There’s not much else to say here — it’s truly a great cash back rate with no hoops to jump through. There’s something refreshing about the simplicity here, and it’s especially great for beginners.\n\n\nBut there’s other features that didn’t get as much attention and are also worth highlighting.\n\n\nNo foreign transaction fees\n\n-----------------------------\n\n\nNo foreign transaction fees means you can truly use this card to earn 3% on _everything_, including that shopping spree in Milan.\n\n\nWaiving foreign transaction fees used to limited to high annual fee cards, but recently low/no annual fee cards have been introducing it too, including the Apple Card and the Capital One Quicksilver. The Robinhood Gold card is by far the most versatile and valuable of these though. For those who don’t like to carry many cards, you can now ditch whatever low annual fee, no foreign transaction fee card you might have and get 3% on your abroad expenses instead.\n\n\nSpend using Virtual Cards\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nThis is actually the perk I’m most excited for with this card, because as far as I know, **no other card on the market offers native virtual cards**.\n\n\nVirtual cards let you hide your true credit card number when spending online, and allow you to set an expiry date and spending limit. The killer use case here is managing subscriptions: if you just want 1 month of Hulu to [binge Shogun](https://variety.com/2024/tv/spotlight/shogun-review-fx-game-of-thrones-1235920586/), you can load a virtual card with $8 and have it expire in a month. If you forget to cancel your subscription, it won’t matter; your payment method will be invalid by the month’s end anyway.\n\n\nVirtual card services like [Privacy](https://privacy.com/home-lp2?lc=s5&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqpSwBhClARIsADlZ_TmYPNnopIAegaNSAv-1g2IxNNTPeKsIs5akdu-pT9UKHIdMxaYtMa4aAqseEALw_wcB) have existed for a while, but as third party services they’re not as convenient, and their free offerings aren’t as robust as what Robinhood seems to be providing here.\n\n\nSurprising amount of protections\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\nThe Robinhood Gold card is part of the Visa Signature family, which comes with various optional benefits that credit card providers can activate. I’m happy to say Robinhood really went for extra credit here; this card is loaded with benefits, including:\n\n\n*   Purchase security: If you buy something nice and it gets lost or stolen in 90 days, you can get up to $1k back.\n\n\n*   Extended warranties: You can extend the warranty of new purchases by up to a year.\n\n\n*   Return protection: If you aren’t satisfied with a recent purchase and the store won’t take it back, you can get reimbursed up to $250.\n\n\n*   Trip cancellation protection: If you get injured before or during a trip, you can get up to $2k to cover nonrefundable arrangements.\n\n\n*   Auto rental collision damage waiver: You can skip the insurance at the rental car office when you use you card to rent.\n\n\nMany other low annual fee cards have some subset of these perks, but Robinhood is giving you basically everything. If you’ve got premium cards like an Amex platinum, you likely already have access to many of these perks (and with better limits), but this is still spectacular for what is effectively a starter card. The only notable perk that’s missing here is cell phone protection (get reimbursed if your phone is lost/stolen).\n\n\n5% cash back when booking travel\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\n…but that travel has to be booked through Robinhood’s forthcoming travel portal. Now if you’ve used these travel portals through Chase or Amex or other cards, you know these portals aren’t that fun or convenient to use. Also, sometimes these portals don’t have the flights and hotels you’re interested in. Robinhood’s portal isn’t live so it’s hard to make judgements quite yet, but something tells me it won’t be groundbreaking here.\n\n\n5% cash back has been emerging as a popular number for spend in travel portals, so this number isn’t as groundbreaking as the 3% cash back. You’ll earn the same with a Chase Freedom or a Capital One Quicksilver. But still, 5% is 5%, and it’s good to see Robinhood meeting the industry standard here.\n\n\nWhat’s not so great\n\n=====================\n\n\nYou need Robinhood Gold…and you need to maintain it\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe card’s $0 annual fee branding is a little bit misleading. In order to get the card, you’ll need to be a Robinhood Gold subscriber. But you also need to _maintain_ Robinhood Gold to keep the card.\n\n\nThis will be one of the first times I’ve seen a card’s good standing status tied to some external monthly subscription, and I’m not totally sure how this will work. If you decide not to pause your Robinhood Gold subscription for a month or two, do they close your credit card? Who knows.\n\n\nFortunately, Robinhood Gold is only $5/month, and if you already invest with Robinhood, it’s a bit of a no brainer: you’ll get a free $1k in margin, lower margin interest rates, 5% on uninvested cash, and more.\n\n\nThis card earns cash back, not points\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nIn the world of cash back cards, Robinhood’s 3% universal cash back might as well make it the new king. But cash back cards are the little league since they aren’t nearly as flexible or value as cards earning points. That’s because **the value of cash back is fixed but the value of points is variable**. 1¢ of cash back is 1¢ of cash back and will always be just 1¢ of cash back. But depending on your skill and luck, 1 point could be redeemed for anything from 1¢ to 10¢. That means a card that earns a standard 1x points on everything could be the equivalent of earning 1% to 10% cash back depending on _how you use_ those points.\n\n\nShreycation is all about helping you learn how to use your points well. With some basic knowledge, it’s pretty easy to achieve a rate of at least 2¢/point on virtually all of your award travel redemptions. That means a card like the Chase Freedom Unlimited that earns 1.5x points on everything nets me _at least_ 3¢ per dollar I spend. On the other hand, the Robinhood Gold card also earns me 3¢ per dollar, but that’s a hard cap — it’ll _only_ earn me 3¢ per dollar.\n\n\nTwo ways you can spend $100. Obviously taking the cash back option for Chase isn’t the move, but transferring those points into say, United, could get you more value than the Robinhood card gives you. Especially if you use the Chase Freedom Unlimited on dining or drugstores.\n\n\nNo sign up bonus or intro 0% APR\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\nThe Robinhood Gold account comes with no sign up bonuses or introductory 0% APR rates whatsoever. For other cards in this category, there’s usually a ~$200 sign up bonus, and at least 1 year of 0% APR.\n\n\nIf you intend on actively using this card for many years, the lack of a bonus might not be a huge issue today, but do note that it’ll take almost $7k in spending to match the free sign up bonus of its peers.\n\n\nThe bigger issue is the lack of a 0% APR intro period. Right now, if you rack up a $10k balance on a card with 12 months of 0% APR, you can instead invest all that money in a high yield savings account and earn 5% over the course of the year.",

      "content": "# Snacks: Alaska joins Bilt\n\n\n\n### Also: half off London flights, check if you're flying Boeing, and more\n\n\nBy [Shrey G](https://substack.com/@shreycation)\n\n\nMar 21, 2024\n\n\nHi Shreycationers,\n\n\nIt’s been a minute! Some awesome stuff coming soon, but for now, a nice ol’ bag of snacks.\n\n\n\n## Alaska Airlines Joins Bilt\n\n\nAlaska Airlines has some of the best redemptions in the market, but they’ve always been so hard to claim since Alaska wasn’t a transfer partner of any major credit card. Read: if you want Alaska miles, you gotta fly Alaska.\n\n\n**That changed last week, when Bilt signed on Alaska as a transfer partner.** I swear, I’m not sponsored by Bilt but they do keep rolling out the hits. I’m actually surprised they managed to make this partnership work, but they also did manage to break through with American Airlines, and American + Alaska have their own partnership too now … maybe just a simple matter of 2 + 2.\n\n\nAlaska Airlines’ Mileage Plan program has a couple awesome attributes:\n\n\n*   You can book flights across all of oneworld (e.g. American, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Qatar, Qantas, Iberia) AND their non-alliance partners (e.g. Korean Air, Singapore Airlines, LATAM). This list covers some of the best airlines in the world!\n\n\n*   You can book free stopovers even on one-way awards. If you don’t know what a stopover is, [I’ve written extensively about them before](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-3) — it’s your way to turn a single trip into multiple for free.\n\n\n[![The Complete Guide to Japan Airlines First Class | Prince of Travel](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0348fd0-f9d2-48e9-af42-4614d4610630_1000x667.jpeg \"The Complete Guide to Japan Airlines First Class | Prince of Travel\")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KnY-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0348fd0-f9d2-48e9-af42-4614d4610630_1000x667.jpeg)\n\n\nAlaska Airlines Mileage Plan is one of the most popular ways to book premium cabins on Japan Airlines (credit: [Prince of Travel](https://princeoftravel.com/airlines/japan-airlines-first-class/))\n\n\nHere’s how you can use all this to your advantage. Let’s say you want to do a huge Asia trip. You can book NYC <> HKG (Hong Kong) with a stopover in Tokyo on the way there and another stopover in Singapore on the way back. This would usually cost you 152k miles if you booked every leg individually, but thanks to the free stopover policy, you only spend 108k miles. Valuing your miles at 2¢/point, that’s $880 saved on a 3 destination Asia trip.\n\n\n_H/t to my buddy Sweyn for sending me this even before it came up on my news feed._\n\n\n\n## Check if you’re on a Boeing plane\n\n\nBoeing has been in the news for [all](https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-incident-involving-missing-door-plug-boeing-737/story?id=106191494)\n [the](https://www.axios.com/2024/03/07/boeing-737-max-ntsb-investigation)\n [wrong](https://qz.com/united-airlines-boeing-plane-missing-panel-1851342848)\n [reasons](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/24-injured-after-technical-problem-latam-sydney-auckland-flight-nz-herald-2024-03-11/)\n [lately](https://abc7news.com/flight-emergency-sfo-tire-falls-from-united-airlines-to-osaka-35/14500843/). I won’t care to speculate on the causes here, but even though [air travel remains remarkably safe](https://slate.com/technology/2024/02/plane-safety-boeing-door-plug-flying-should-i-drive-instead.html), it’s understandable if you to avoid Boeing so you can sleep better on your flight.\n\n\nIf you’ve got a flight coming up, **you can check out [amiflyingonaboeing.com](http://amiflyingonaboeing.com/), made by yours truly to quickly check what aircraft you’re flying on.**\n\n\n\n## 50% off London flights via Virgin Atlantic\n\n\nVirgin Atlantic has a 50% off deal on all award flights from the US to the UK **ending midnight tonight**!\n\n\nThat means for a sample NYC <> LHR trip:\n\n\n*   economy roundtrips start from 10k miles (usually 20k)\n\n\n*   premium economy roundtrips start from 17.5k miles (usually 35k)\n\n\n*   business economy roundtrips start from 47.5k miles (usually 95k)\n\n\nNote that this only applies to flights on Virgin Atlantic itself, and must involve trips that complete before June 30.\n\n\nNow there is one somewhat unfortunate issue preventing this from being one of the greatest points deals this year. Virgin Atlantic charges [fuel surcharges on award flights](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/141743217/wait-why-am-i-being-charged-cash-too), meaning you can’t just focus on the miles cost. For example, a roundtrip starting May 10th requires 10k Virgin miles + $492, but the equivalent “Economy Classic” ticket would cost $667. That still values your miles at 1.75¢/point (($667 - $492) / 10000), but it’s not amazing. Premium economy gives you some better value, at 3.1¢/point (would usually cost $1773 in cash).\n\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b11bb76-2b02-49bd-96f6-09df5cfcf81a_2350x622.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uZae!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b11bb76-2b02-49bd-96f6-09df5cfcf81a_2350x622.png)\n\n\nSample roundtrip for NYC <> LHR for May 10 - May 14\n\n\n**But there’s a hack**. I won’t get into the weeds here, but often you can **get cheaper fuel surcharges if you book two separate one-way tickets rather than one roundtrip.** For example, here’s what happens if I book the same premium economy itinerary, but as two one ways.\n\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91403a4e-33b6-4153-a621-2b4b92b2f6e5_2354x622.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xjDz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91403a4e-33b6-4153-a621-2b4b92b2f6e5",

      "content": "# Snacks: How to girl math your Lyfts\n\n\n\n### Your Lyfts could be free...if you know what you're doing.\n\n\nBy [Shrey G](https://substack.com/@shreycation)\n\n\nIt’s Saturday and a lot of you are about to end your night by taking a $50 Lyft back home. Not a fun expense, but saving 20% on it would make it feel a bit better.\n\n\nThis isn’t a limited time discount — **turns out you can get** _**at least**_ **20% off any time on your Lyfts**. It just requires a bit of [girl math](https://mashable.com/article/what-is-girl-math-explained).\n\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf62150d-3335-4a03-8e1a-da7744265162_1280x768.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_wwK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf62150d-3335-4a03-8e1a-da7744265162_1280x768.webp)\n\n\nIf you’re about to ride one of these in about 6-7 hours from now, listen up! Credit: [Solo Traveller](https://www.solotravellerapp.com/is-lyft-more-expensive-at-night/)\n\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve earns a whopping 10x points on Lyft rides. Last year I flew a $10000 business class itinerary in United Polaris business class by transferring 99k Chase points to United MileagePlus, garnering a value of 10¢/point. I definitely had some of my Lyfts contribute to those 99k points, and since I earned 10x points and redeemed those points for 10¢ a point, **I effectively got $1 back for every $1 I spent on a Lyft**. **In other words, my Lyfts were free.**\n\n\nNow a 10¢/point redemption isn’t super common and mostly exists when flying premium cabins, but even if you just redeem on economy flights, you can still get a pretty sizable discount on your Lyfts. At the very least, you can redeem Chase points in the Chase portal directly for 1.5¢/point. But if you transfer those points into airlines, you can easily and routinely get at least 2¢/point. That means you’re effectively earning 20¢ per dollar you spend on Lyft — 20% off!\n\n\nSo next time it’s late at night and you’re Lyfting back home, know that if you girl math it, you’re at least getting it at a discount.\n\n\n(_Unfortunately for my Uber loyalists, this arbitrage is a Lyft only thing. The Capital One Savor cards will give you 10% off Ubers, [but 10% isn’t the same as 10x points](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/143026629/this-card-earns-cash-back-not-points)._)\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIf you’re subscribed yet, this is your sign.

      "content": "### Procrastinators rejoice: you can still fly to Europe for 15k miles each way\n\n\n[Shrey G](https://substack.com/@shreycation)\n\n\nMay 30, 2025\n\n\nHi Shreycationers,\n\n\nIt’s been a while! I hope you didn’t miss me too much, but rest assured, Shreycation is back and here to stay. In a later post I’ll share a bit more about what I’ve been up to (launching the world’s first hybrid human + AI travel agency, [Anecdote Travel](https://anecdote.travel/)!), but for now, there’s something more pressing: helping you get flights for your Europe summer plans.\n\n\nNothing quite says summer like hopping across the Atlantic to sip an Aperol spritz, but if you’re a procrastinator like me, those flights are getting pricey.\n\n\n[clear wine glass with orange liquid](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1615830783066-26a99bc9d959?fm=jpg&q=60&w=3000&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\n\n\nI know I can just buy some Aperol from my local Safeway, but it just tastes better in Europe ya feel?\n\n\nHere’s the price map for roundtrips between San Francisco and various spots in Europe. Big yikes:\n\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7afed0cd-955d-4663-842d-71690e2c734b_2212x1580.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1Xmb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7afed0cd-955d-4663-842d-71690e2c734b_2212x1580.png)\n\n\nReally, there’s nothing south of $1000. Fortunately, you read Shreycation and we’ve identified the best opportunities for you to use your points. Here’s how you can get your bank to pick up the tab for your sunny spree on the Spanish coast.\n\n\n\n### Air France/KLM Flying Blue\n\n\n[You may remember my love for the Air France and KLM’s joint program, Flying Blue.](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-1#%C2%A7air-franceklm-flying-blue-for-insanely-cheap-trips-to-europe) Every month, Flying Blue chooses a set of cities to enjoy a promotional discount of 25% off — if you fly from those cities to basically anywhere in Europe, you’ll be able to enjoy the promo rate, if they have availability.\n\n\nEconomy flights between the USA and Europe cost 25k Flying Blue points one-way usually, so with the 25% discount, you’re looking at 18.75k points instead. And as a cherry on top, if you’ve got a Chase card, Chase Ultimate Rewards currently has a 25% transfer bonus to Flying Blue. **That means you just need to transfer 15k Chase points to Flying Blue** — that’ll get boosted to 18.75k, and you’re looking at a free flight to Europe!\n\n\nThe current promo cities are also quite convenient for my coastal readers here: **San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington, Miami, Boston**, and even my hometown of **Phoenix** are all getting repped this time! Even some of my readers over in Asia are getting some love, with discount fares from Hong Kong and Singapore. I’ve rarely seen such a convenient set of origin cities for Flying Blue promo award, so take advantage now. ([Full list of promo cities here](https://www.flyingblue.us/en/spend/flights/rewards).)\n\n\nGenerally, I saw a decent amount of availability left for July and August flights. Here’s a sample one I found for SF to Madrid on July 5:\n\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0106fa-d952-4d4f-b2c5-819da41fc74c_1910x754.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BWS5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0106fa-d952-4d4f-b2c5-819da41fc74c_1910x754.png)\n\n\nFlying Blue does charge you for fuel surcharges, so you’ll still owe some money, but it’s still a great deal. Let’s do some quick maths: this flight costs $610 on Google Flights, so after the $120 in surcharges, we’re using 18750 Flying Blue miles to pay for the remaining $490. If you’re transferring from Chase, you’re really only burning 15000 Chase points, so that’s **$490/15000 = 3.2¢/point, more than double what your points are worth in the Chase portal**!\n\n\nIf you like a little more luxury, business class tickets are 45k points as long as you fly from Montreal — this might be a viable move for my NYC friends here (just grab a cheap NYC > Montreal flight, and fly business across the pond).\n\n\nA few quick tips for this Flying Blue promotion:\n\n\n*   **The promotion is almost over — May 31 is the last day to book.** However, you can book for any dates up till Oct 31, so there’s no need to fly soon. New promo rates will go live in June, but the origin cities might not be this convenient.\n\n\n*   If you need to change or cancel, it costs 70 EUR. Even if you’re not sure about your trip, given how good the savings are, it might still be worth getting a ticket.\n\n\n*   Even if you don’t live in one of the origin cities, you can just buy a cheap flight to one of those cities, and then fly from there.\n\n\n*   Not all dates will have the promo rates still available. We’re in the last 2 days of this promotion, so many June dates are gone by now, but just use their point calendar at the top of the search screen to locate the 18750 mile fares. It bugs out sometimes when you search roundtrips, so I’d suggest searching one-ways instead.\n\n\n\n### Virgin Atlantic\n\n\nAnother one of my favorite hacks for getting to Europe for cheap is using Virgin Atlantic. For many summer dates, you can fly from NYC to London for just 12k Virgin Atlantic miles. And even better, Chase is also running a 25% transfer bonus for Virgin Atlantic too — you can be in London for just 9600 Chase points.\n\n\n[![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31661910-efa0-49b7-8373-1dfb4daa5629_1802x536.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yqjg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31661910-efa0-49b7-8373-1dfb4daa5629_1802x536.png)\n\n\nNote that Virgin Atlantic does also charge fuel surcharges, but like with Flying Blue, it’s still a great deal. This flight would usually cost $358 on Google Flights, so after deducting the $76 surcharge and factoring in the Chase transfer bonus, you",

      "content": "# Snacks: fly cross-country for just 5k points?!\n\n\n\n### Deal of the month courtesy of Air Canada 🤝 Bilt\n\n\n[Shrey G](https://substack.com/@shreycation)\n\n\nJan 30, 2024\n\n\n_This snack covers a Bilt-specific deal, but if you don’t have one, scroll down because there’s still a bonus snack for you to nibble on!_\n\n\nI’ve mentioned before that [one of the best ways to fly cross-country](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/turkish-airlines-miles-and-smiles-for-domestic-coast-to-coast-trips-on-united)\n routes like NYC <> SFO/LAX is via Turkish Airlines for 7.5k points. **But on February 1, we get to breathe rare air and go up to 33% cheaper.**\n\n\nBilt has a habit of pulling out some [killer transfer bonuses on the 1st of the month](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140605279/rent-day-promotions)\n\n, and February is no exception. **On February 1, Bilt is offering a whopping 75-150% transfer bonus to Air Canada’s Aeroplan frequent flyer program.** Your exact bonus depends on your status level with Bilt, which you can check in the app.\n\n\n[Higher status in Bilt gets you higher transfer bonuses on Rent Day. Makes it worth getting Bilt status!](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JQ-z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d9ab82b-dc89-45bc-a6a4-8a1e5cca89dd_1170x897.png)\n\n\n**I want to emphasize how crazy this deal is.** In the past, programs like Chase have offered a 20% bonus; even the lowest-tier Bilt members get almost 4 times that here!\n\n\n**Now here’s how you turn that into the cheapest cross-country flight I’ve ever seen.** We can go on the Air Canada Aeroplan site and look up EWR <> SFO flights on March 5 and we’ll see these options:\n\n\n[This is a live example, and chances are you’ll still be able to book it on Feb 1.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UHRM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d29b452-773e-4388-bea9-075f17498807_840x478.png)\n\n\nFlying cross-country takes 12.5k Aeroplan miles on a typical day, which usually means transferring 12.5k Bilt points. But on Feb 1 we’re armed with a huge transfer bonus from Bilt, which means it could cost **as low as 12.5/2.5 = 5k Bilt points** if you’re Bilt Platinum. But even if you’re just Bilt Blue, it’s still just 7.2k points — strictly better than transferring 7.5k points to Turkish! _Also, the cash value of regular economy on these flights is $165. **That values your Bilt points as much as 3.3¢/point.** That’s pretty darn good, especially for economy!_\n\n\n**This deal is ONLY available on Feb 1,** so make sure not to miss out! Aeroplan is quickly becoming one of the most compelling Star Alliance programs, and I’m not sure when we’ll be lucky enough to see an Aeroplan bonus this crazy again.\n\n\n_But Shrey, I can’t really commit to a flight today._ That’s fine! All you need to do on Feb 1 is transfer some miles. You can book later.\n\n\n_Do Aeroplan miles expire?_ That is a great question. Aeroplan miles do expire 18 months after you receive them, but only if you have zero activity on your Aeroplan account. Basically anything you do with Aeroplan resets the clock, _including transferring more points_. So if you’re worried about forgetting, [you can add yourself to this calendar invite](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MmhzZ2dmYTduNTQwN29yZnZrZGg2dGJqNjYgMmVlYzY2NWEyYjU3MGY5MTVmZmViMGI5YjYzODA0NmU2MmM1ZWU5N2VmNDljZTMxMTIxNzAzZTU4NTMxYTUyNUBn&tmsrc=2eec665a2b570f915ffeb0b9b638046e62c5ee97ef49ce31121703e58531a525%40group.calendar.google.com)\n for July 2025, which will remind you to transfer the minimal amount of points to Aeroplan to delay expiration.\n\n\n_Is NYC <> SFO the only good route to book?_ Nope! You can use this transfer bonus to book any of the awesome routes in the bonus snack below.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIf this article made you curious about the Bilt card, you can [learn more in my review here](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-2)\n\n.

Applying will likely affect your credit score.)_\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n## Bonus Snack: Air Canada vs. United\n\n\nYou know how your Chipotle bowl costs 20% more because of inflation? Turns out points are affected by inflation too, and in summer 2023, United _devalued_ their points program. Routes that may have cost just 35k United miles now cost upwards of 55k. This opens the field for other programs to offer some great deals.\n\n\n**United MileagePlus used to be one of the most cost-effective ways to book many Star Alliance flights on points, but now Air Canada Aeroplan is eyeing that crown.** Let’s analyze some of the most popular travel routes:\n\n\n[Aeroplan outperforms in the vast majority of routes except for West Coast <> Europe. Especially great savings come from the short-haul North American routes, North America <> West/South Asia routes, and North America <> South America routes.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9tHD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ba9730d-361e-43a8-9b5e-3d25caa00170_1386x572.png)\n\n\nEagle-eyed readers will notice that Air Canada levies higher cash fees on their award flights. But don’t worry, the math is mathing. Let’s take North America <> East Asia for example: 50k miles + 77 CAD on Aeroplan vs. 55k miles + 6 USD on United. 77 CAD is about 56 USD, meaning there’s a difference of +50 USD and -5k miles between the two. 5k miles is worth just 50 USD _only if you’re a points novice and value each mile at 1¢/point._ But the whole point of Shreycation is to help you [get way more value from your points than the default 1¢/point](https://shreycation.substack.com/i/140407300/for-beginners-why-do-transfer-partners-matter)\n\n, so just by subscribing, you’re making those 5k miles worth way more than 50 USD! The math indeed maths.\n\n\nAnd if you’re wondering why the Delhi route is so cheap, it’s because Air Canada considers India part of the “Atlantic” region, along with all of Europe and Africa. Air Canada is filled with fun sweet spots like this that I’ll cover in depth in the future.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThanks for reading!",

It’s called a **stopover**, and it’s the easiest hack for adding an extra stop to your itinerary.\n\n\nHere’s how it works. Let’s say I’m traveling from NYC to Delhi during mid March. There’s a $411 option that involves connecting through Abu Dhabi (AUH) with a 3.5 hour layover:\n\n\nBut Abu Dhabi is beautiful and maybe I’m not quite satisfied just exploring the airport — after all, if I’m connecting through Abu Dhabi anyway, I might as well stay there for a few nights and explore! This mean I need to book 2 separate one-way trips (JFK > AUH, AUH > DEL), but that costs a total of $802; almost double my original itinerary price!\n\n\nHere’s the secret galaxy brain travelers know: **Etihad has a free stopover program where they’ll let you book an itinerary with a multi-day Abu Dhabi stay in between, but without the extra markup + taxes from booking two separate one-way trips.** In other words, Etihad will just pretend you’ve booked a single trip (NYC-DEL in this case) that just happens to have a verrrrryyy long connection in their home city (AUH). Getting this free stopover is easy; I simply go to the Etihad site and check the box saying I’d like a free stopover:\n\n\nThis gives me access to a new itinerary option that costs $434, **almost the same price as my original itinerary**, but with one big difference: **I get a 48 hr connection time rather than just 3.5 hrs.** And obviously, I’m more than welcome to leave the airport and explore the city during that time.\n\n\nSo far, Etihad has subsidized my airfare by effectively treating my two separate trips as if it were just one. But Etihad goes one step further and actually **comps my hotel for up to 2 nights!** Etihad will let you choose from one of nine 3-star partner hotels for your complimentary stay (usually would cost $60-$100/night). Etihad also gives you the option to upgrade your stay by giving you deep 40% discounts on bougie 5-star hotels like the Shangri-La Qaryat Al Beri or the Grand Hyatt Abu Dhabi ([details here](https://www.etihad.com/en-us/abu-dhabi/stopover)).\n\n\nLet’s recap. I was going from NYC to Delhi but noticed I had a connection in AUH. Initially I was going to just rot at my gate for a lackluster 3.5 hr layover, but **because of Etihad’s stopover program, I’m actually able to explore the glory of Abu Dhabi for 2 nights for practically the same cost**! That’s 2 trips for the price of one! (If you’re doing the math, between the subsidized airfare and the free hotels, that one little stopover checkbox on the Etihad site has **saved me over $500**.)\n\n\nLiterally get to spend 48 hours exploring these tall buildings at practically no extra cost, all thanks to stopovers.\n\n\nInspired to enjoy a free stopover with a friend? Let them know!\n\n\nQuick Vocab Note: Layover vs Stopover\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nLayovers are less than 24hrs in length, and usually don’t involve leaving the airport. The vast majority of flight connections are layovers — you’re just there as a means to an end.\n\n\nStopovers are usually 24hrs or more, and involve you intentionally leaving the airport to explore the city. The connecting city becomes a destination in and of itself.\n\n\nSome stopover programs require you to contact customer support, so knowing the difference and using precise language with the support rep can expedite your process.\n\n\nWhy do free stopovers even exist?\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nAs you saw in the Etihad example, stopovers save you a ton of money on multi-city trips. But why does Etihad care about subsidizing your travel like this? Why do free stopover programs even exist? To answer these questions, we need a quick airlines industry lesson.\n\n\nMany of the world’s major airlines are at least partially, if not majority-owned by their home government. The Singaporean government’s investment arm, Temasek, owns 56% of Singapore Airlines. TAP Portugal was swallowed up by the Portuguese government in 2020 when they bought out 72.5% of the carrier — the list goes on. These nationalized carriers are often called “flag carriers.”\n\n\nMost governments have an active interest in boosting tourism to their nation. Since they have a majority stake in their flag carriers, foreign governments can use them to incentivize impulse visits by implementing stopover programs. So when Etihad offers you a free stopover in Abu Dhabi, you’re getting your travels subsidized by the Emirati government in the hope that you’ll come again and maybe even tell your friends. Talk about customer acquisition cost…\n\n\n_This concept might be a bit foreign to us in the USA; the airlines industry was deregulated and privatized in America in the 70s, so the USA doesn’t have official “flag carriers” that have the US government’s investment and blessing. For my international readers, that means stopovers in the US aren’t really a thing (although there is a hack that I’ll share in a future Shreycation Snack!)._\n\n\nFive awesome stopover programs\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nThere’s a ton of stopover programs out there, and they all vary in their perks, pricing, and how long you’re allowed to stay. Most aren’t as generous as Etihad and won’t comp your hotel, but in all cases, **the programs below will let you stay a few days in their host city without needing to book separate one-way tickets**, which saves you some dough. Other programs let you do free stopovers, but only on award tickets (i.e. tickets you buy using points/miles).\n\n\nGoing through all the stopover programs is beyond the scope of this article, but I will introduce a few fan favorites:\n\n\n\n### **Turkish Airlines**\n\n\nLike Etihad, Turkish also gives you a truly free stopover experience with hotels and all. The rules are a little more specific though: you need to have already booked a route with a 20hr+ layover in Istanbul (IST). If you are, you’re entitled to (a) stopover without increasing your airfare and (b) one night in a 4-star hotel if you’re flying economy, or two nights in a 5-star hotel if you’re flying business! This can be a fantastic way to explore one of the world’s oldest and most historic cities.\n\n\nAs always though, Turkish is a little behind the times on technology. There may be little indication during the booking process that your flight is eligible, and you’ll need to [contact them via email](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-us/flights/stopover/) to actually arrange your stopover (it’s not an automatic process like others on this list).\n\n\n_What if my layover is less than 24 hours?_ Well turns out Turkish still has something for ya! If your layover is 6-20 hrs, Turkish offers layover service! You can just hit up a “TourIstanbul” counter during your layover and they’ll put you on a tour bus and show you around and give you a meal for free. If you’re at the upper end of this layover range (12+ hrs), Turkish will let you relax in a hotel for free too (think of this as “Stopover-Lite”).\n\n\nLinks: [Stopovers](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-us/flights/stopover/), [TourIstanbul](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/flights/fly-different/touristanbul/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAzc2tBhA6EiwArv-i6WOK199CUNUzALEcBTgMBLGLUZlCrSE5Y8k7udO77RZxLuQ3TT-_ghoCnQ8QAvD_BwE), [Layover hotels](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/flights/hotel-service)\n\n\n\n### JAL\n\n\nJapan Airlines will let you spend 1-6 nights in Tokyo or Osaka. If you’re heading to say, Niseko for skiing this season, might as well throw in a stop at Tokyo! Technically, you should be able to use [Japan Airlines’ multicity booking tool](https://www.jal.co.jp/en/booking/freedom/) to just specify your desired stopover, and it should give you the same price as with a non-stopover itinerary. In practice, JAL’s tech isn’t that great, so sometimes you’ll see the price jump. No worries though; you can call up their booking agents and they can set up the stopover without the price difference.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n**I’m working on a definitive guide to stopovers** that covers all the carriers that offer free stopovers, and the easiest way to",

But looks aren’t everything. Let’s dive in and see what this card is made of.\n\n\n(It’s made of 17 grams of stainless steel.)\n\n\n_(Disclaimer: This post is not financial advice and you should do your own research to ensure the cards mentioned in this article are right for you. Applying will likely affect your credit score.)_\n\n\nWhat’s great\n\n\n==============\n\n\nFirst things first, Robinhood’s done a great job stealing headlines with this card, and it’s not just all show. This is indeed a wonderfully designed card.\n\n\n\n## A simple 3% cash back on everything\n\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nEveryone’s talking about the flagship feature, the 3% cash back on everything. **And with good reason: 3% is the highest base cash back rate across any card I’ve seen.** There’s not much else to say here — it’s truly a great cash back rate with no hoops to jump through. There’s something refreshing about the simplicity here, and it’s especially great for beginners.\n\n\nBut there’s other features that didn’t get as much attention and are also worth highlighting.\n\n\n\n## No foreign transaction fees\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n\nNo foreign transaction fees means you can truly use this card to earn 3% on _everything_, including that shopping spree in Milan.\n\n\nWaiving foreign transaction fees used to limited to high annual fee cards, but recently low/no annual fee cards have been introducing it too, including the Apple Card and the Capital One Quicksilver. The Robinhood Gold card is by far the most versatile and valuable of these though. For those who don’t like to carry many cards, you can now ditch whatever low annual fee, no foreign transaction fee card you might have and get 3% on your abroad expenses instead.\n\n\n\n## Spend using Virtual Cards\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nThis is actually the perk I’m most excited for with this card, because as far as I know, **no other card on the market offers native virtual cards**.\n\n\nVirtual cards let you hide your true credit card number when spending online, and allow you to set an expiry date and spending limit. The killer use case here is managing subscriptions: if you just want 1 month of Hulu to [binge Shogun](https://variety.com/2024/tv/spotlight/shogun-review-fx-game-of-thrones-1235920586/), you can load a virtual card with $8 and have it expire in a month. If you forget to cancel your subscription, it won’t matter; your payment method will be invalid by the month’s end anyway.\n\n\nVirtual card services like [Privacy](https://privacy.com/home-lp2?lc=s5&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqpSwBhClARIsADlZ_TmYPNnopIAegaNSAv-1g2IxNNTPeKsIs5akdu-pT9UKHIdMxaYtMa4aAqseEALw_wcB) have existed for a while, but as third party services they’re not as convenient, and their free offerings aren’t as robust as what Robinhood seems to be providing here.\n\n\n\n## Surprising amount of protections\n\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\nThe Robinhood Gold card is part of the Visa Signature family, which comes with various optional benefits that credit card providers can activate. I’m happy to say Robinhood really went for extra credit here; this card is loaded with benefits, including:\n\n\n*   Purchase security: If you buy something nice and it gets lost or stolen in 90 days, you can get up to $1k back.\n\n*   Extended warranties: You can extend the warranty of new purchases by up to a year.\n\n*   Return protection: If you aren’t satisfied with a recent purchase and the store won’t take it back, you can get reimbursed up to $250.\n\n*   Trip cancellation protection: If you get injured before or during a trip, you can get up to $2k to cover nonrefundable arrangements.\n\n*   Auto rental collision damage waiver: You can skip the insurance at the rental car office when you use you card to rent.\n\n\nMany other low annual fee cards have some subset of these perks, but Robinhood is giving you basically everything. If you’ve got premium cards like an Amex platinum, you likely already have access to many of these perks (and with better limits), but this is still spectacular for what is effectively a starter card. The only notable perk that’s missing here is cell phone protection (get reimbursed if your phone is lost/stolen).\n\n\n\n## 5% cash back when booking travel\n\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\n…but that travel has to be booked through Robinhood’s forthcoming travel portal. Now if you’ve used these travel portals through Chase or Amex or other cards, you know these portals aren’t that fun or convenient to use. Also, sometimes these portals don’t have the flights and hotels you’re interested in. Robinhood’s portal isn’t live so it’s hard to make judgements quite yet, but something tells me it won’t be groundbreaking here.\n\n\n5% cash back has been emerging as a popular number for spend in travel portals, so this number isn’t as groundbreaking as the 3% cash back. You’ll earn the same with a Chase Freedom or a Capital One Quicksilver. But still, 5% is 5%, and it’s good to see Robinhood meeting the industry standard here.\n\n\nWhat’s not so great\n\n\n=====================\n\n\n\n## You need Robinhood Gold…and you need to maintain it\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe card’s $0 annual fee branding is a little bit misleading. In order to get the card, you’ll need to be a Robinhood Gold subscriber. But you also need to _maintain_ Robinhood Gold to keep the card.\n\n\nThis will be one of the first times I’ve seen a card’s good standing status tied to some external monthly subscription, and I’m not totally sure how this will work. If you decide not to pause your Robinhood Gold subscription for a month or two, do they close your credit card? Who knows.\n\n\nFortunately, Robinhood Gold is only $5/month, and if you already invest with Robinhood, it’s a bit of a no brainer: you’ll get a free $1k in margin, lower margin interest rates, 5% on uninvested cash, and more.\n\n\n\n## This card earns cash back, not points\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nIn the world of cash back cards, Robinhood’s 3% universal cash back might as well make it the new king. But cash back cards are the little league since they aren’t nearly as flexible or value as cards earning points. That’s because **the value of cash back is fixed but the value of points is variable**. 1¢ of cash back is 1¢ of cash back and will always be just 1¢ of cash back. But depending on your skill and luck, 1 point could be redeemed for anything from 1¢ to 10¢. That means a card that earns a standard 1x points on everything could be the equivalent of earning 1% to 10% cash back depending on _how you use_ those points.\n\n\nShreycation is all about helping you learn how to use your points well. With some basic knowledge, it’s pretty easy to achieve a rate of at least 2¢/point on virtually all of your award travel redemptions. That means a card like the Chase Freedom Unlimited that earns 1.5x points on everything nets me _at least_ 3¢ per dollar I spend. On the other hand, the Robinhood Gold card also earns me 3¢ per dollar, but that’s a hard cap — it’ll _only_ earn me 3¢ per dollar.\n\n\n![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a84cf1d-5774-4839-8f32-2290ced0b357_2728x1466.png)\n\n\nTwo ways you can spend $100.

I'm new to the points game and wanted to clarify a few things you mentioned.\n\n\nMy understanding is that for people who are starting travel hacking, Bilt is not a great card because there is no signup bonus, which, if your goal is to travel hack, is how you will rack up most of your points.\n\n\nMy thinking is that it's best to get Bilt and use it for rent, and for your minimum 5 transactions each moth, and then after that to put all your spend on cards you are trying to get signup bonuses for.\n\n\nMy thinking is that if I have $5K to spend, even with the crazy Bilt transfer bonuses, it doesn't compare to getting 75K or 100K points from a signup.\n\n\nExpand full comment\n\n\nReply\n\n\nShare",

      "title": "Snacks: Earn Free Miles When Shopping",
      "content": "### I flew NYC to SF for free and all I did was click a button\n\n\nHi y’all,\n\n\nWelcome to Shreycation Snacks. This isn’t a full feature Shreycation issue — it’s a bite-sized snack with tasty tips. Read it on the subway, read it during a boring Zoom call, read it on the toilet — you do you. (Don’t worry, Issue 3 still comes out this week.)\n\n\nEarn free miles on stuff you’re already buying\n\n\nEveryone shops online, but in 2024 it’s time to get rewarded for it. Virtually **every major US airline and credit card program has its own shopping portal where you can earn free miles.** It’s easy. Let’s say I need to get yet another one of my [favorite pants from Theory](https://www.theory.com/raffi-5-pocket-pant-in-neoteric-twill/L0774201_C63.html?dwvar_L0774201__C63_color=C63). If you’ve read [my previous issues](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/issue-1), you can guess I’m a big United MileagePlus fan. Before I buy, I’ll log onto [shopping.mileageplus.com](https://shopping.mileageplus.com/) first, look up Theory, and click the “Shop Now” button. I’ll then proceed to buy the pants using any credit card, and **I’ll get a free 2x United miles for doing basically nothing**, on top of whatever points I get on my credit card**.**\n\n\n**Bam, that’s 400 free miles right there —** same amount you’d get flying LAX to SFO.\n\n\nSometimes these programs will run promos where you’ll earn more miles (like 5x+) at certain merchants. They also run bonuses where if you spend say, $150 across all merchants, you get a bonus 500 miles. Also if you’re ever in the market for one of those money-losing D2C subscription companies (Hello Fresh, Stitch Fix, etc.), they’ll give you hella bonus miles (like 1000+ miles).\n\n\n**It adds up. I’ve been using these for a year and I’ve racked up about 20k miles; I recently used 15k for a last minute NYC-SFO flight that would have cost $400 otherwise.**\n\n\n_Links for portals (**bookmark** **them!**)_: [American](https://www.aadvantageeshopping.com/), [United](https://shopping.mileageplus.com/), [Delta](https://www.skymilesshopping.com/), [Alaska](https://www.mileageplanshopping.com/), [Southwest](https://rapidrewardsshopping.southwest.com/), [JetBlue](https://trueblueshopping.jetblue.com/), [Capital One](https://capitaloneshopping.com/), [Citi](https://www.bonuscashcenter.citicards.com/), [Chase](https://ultimaterewardsearn.chase.com/). (Unfortunately Amex and Bilt don’t have portals.)\n\n\n_Tips for success_:\n\n\n*   Make sure to temporarily turn off your adblocker (cmd + period on Chrome for Mac) OR add the adblock filter list for your preferred shopping portal (e.g. [here’s United’s](https://shopping.mileageplus.com/faq____.htm#adblockQ)).\n\n\n*   Sometimes you can download browser extensions that will pop up whenever you go on a site that earns miles. No need to go to the shopping portal! For example, [here’s United’s](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/apcjkhjbhapedgbekhlhdkidpohpkfne).\n\n\n*   **If you use Honey, you gotta disable it.** No double dipping unfortunately.\n\n\n*   Make sure to complete your purchase in the tab that opens from the portal.\n\n\n*   If you shop via a credit card shopping portal, you’ll usually need to use one of their cards to get the points. For airlines shopping portals, anything works.\n\n\nLiked this snack? Give the gift of knowledge and share with a friend! I’ll be so elated :)\n\n\n[Share](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/snacks-free-miles-shopping-portals?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share)\n\n\n\n### Bonus snack: new Chase Sapphire lounge in LGA just dropped\n\n\nThe lounge battles are heating up. Chase is officially pissed that Amex cornered the market with their Centurion lounges, and they’ve decided enough is enough. Last week, Chase finally opened their hotly-anticipated Sapphire Lounge in LGA terminal B, their third lounge after BOS and HKG (hong kong).\n\n\nThe new LGA lounge is over 21800 sqft with plenty of little nooks for privacy, children’s play room, game room, and conference desks + phone booths. Also, they offer an upscale bar (with cocktails inspired by NYC’s own [Apotheke](https://www.apothekemixology.com/) and wine line from [Parcelle](https://parcellewine.com/pages/135-division)), amazing food (both buffet + a la carte style), and **complimentary mini-facials and skincare kits**. For those who want extra style, they’ve got bookable private suites with caviar and wine service. The only issue is the lounge has no natural light or runway views, but it is very cozy.\n\n\nI haven’t had the pleasure of going yet, but here’s some pictures and videos from others:\n\n\n![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fb32b6e-4e26-4cf9-a1d2-33a0707c0f58.avif)![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6aee9b89-c54b-4a8c-948b-777042d0d352.avif)\n\n\n![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd549d3a-059d-415e-b4ee-731729995950_1600x1067.webp)![](https://shreycation.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a9f2a45-dfe7-4023-9203-1051df572188_1600x1067.webp)\n\n\nPictures from ABC News, Upgraded Points, and The Points Guy. Video below is from my friend Riley!\n\n\n_How to access_: If you have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, you can visit for free whenever with 2 guests. If you have Priority Pass through some other card, you get 1 free visit per year but no free guests.\n\n\nChase also has a JFK lounge opening **tomorrow (!!)** and is adding lounges in LAS, PHL, PHX, and SAN soon.\n\n\n* * *",
